Diets have changed in China C and so too has its top crop. Since 2011, the country   61   (grow) more corn than rice. Corn production has jumped nearly 125 percent over   62   past 25 years, while rice has increased only 7 percent.
A taste for meat is   63   (actual) behind the change: An important part of its corn is used to feed chickens, pigs, and cattle. Another reason for corn’s rise: The government encourages farmers to grow corn instead of rice   64   (improve) water quality. Corn uses less water   65   rice and creates less fertilizer (化肥) runoff. This switch has decreased   66   (pollute) in the country’s major lakes and reservoirs and made drinking water safer for people.

Many westerners   57   come to China cook much less than in their own countries once they realize how cheap   58   can be to eat out. I still remember   59   (visit) a friend who’d lived here for five years and I   60   (shock) when I learnt she hadn’t cooked once in all that time. 　　
 While regularly eating out seems to   61   (become) common for many young people in recent years, it’s not without a cost. The obvious one is money; eating out once or twice a week may be   62   (afford) but doing this most days adds up. There could be an even   63   (high) cost on your health. Researchers have found that there is a direct link between the increase in food eaten outside the home and the rise in   64   (weigh) problems.
If you are not going to suffer this problem, then I suggest that the next time you go to your mum’s home   65   dinner, get a few cooking tips from her. Cooking food can be fun. You might also begin to notice the effects not only on your health but in your pocket.
