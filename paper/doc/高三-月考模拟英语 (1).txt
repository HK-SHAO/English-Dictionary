Often speakers at a meeting experience dry mouths and ask for a glass of water. You can solve the problem by activating the saliva（唾液）in you mouth. First gently bite the edges of your tongue with your teeth. Or, press your entire tongue to the bottom of your mouth and hold it there until the saliva flow. Or you can imagine that you are slicing a big juicy lemon and sucking the juice.
Before you begin your talk, be kind to your voice. Avoid milk or creamy drinks which coat your throat. Keep your throat wet by drinking a little sweetened warm tea or water-down fruit juice.
If you sense that you are losing your voice, stop talking completely. Save your voice for your speech. You may feel foolish using paper to write notes, but the best thing you can do is to rest your voice. If you feel the need to see a doctor, perhaps getting some advice from a professional singer can be a better choice. In the meantime, do not even talk in a low voice.
What about drinking alcohol to wet your throat? I advise you not to touch alcohol before speaking. The problem with alcohol is that one drink gives you a little confidence. The second drink gives you even more confidence. Finally you will feel all-powerful and you will feel you can do everything, but in fact your brain and your mouth do not work together properly. Save the alcohol until after you finish speaking.
Perhaps you want to accept the advice, but you may wonder if you can ever change the habits of a lifetime. Of course you can. Goethe, who lived before indoor skating rinks or swimming pools, said, “We learn to skate in the summer and swim in the winter.” Take this message to heart and give yourself time to develop your new habits. If you are willing to change, you will soon be able to say that you will never forget these techniques because they’ve become a part of your body.
24. Which of the following things does the writer suggest that you should do before you began your talk?
A. Drink water-down fruit juice.
B. Have some drink with cream.
C. Have some cool milk.
D. Have high tea.
25. What does the writer suggest when you feel you are losing your voice?
A. Going to see a doctor.
B. Asking a professional singer for help.
C. Whispering the things that you want to say.
D. Keeping on talking rather than use a paper to write notes.
26. According to the text, what will happen to your speech when you drink alcohol?
A. Your face will be redder and more shining.
B. Your mouth and thought will not be in line.
C. You will be so confident as to carry out your speech perfectly well.
D. You will get excited enough to attract people’s attention in the speech.
27. What is the purpose of the writer to use Goethe’s words?
A. To encourage one to go in for sports.
B. To tell that Goethe had a strong willpower.
C. To prove one can change his habits.
D. To remind people of the techniques to develop a lifelong habits.
C
For centuries, mankind and dogs have suffered from a communication failure. We can tell dogs what we want them to do and sometimes they comply, but we’ve always struggled when it comes to understanding the true meaning of their barks and whimpers. There is exciting news now C a dog translator has been invented to help you communicate with your furry friend
Researchers at?North Carolina State University?have?____?some kind of?miracle dog translator body harness(束腰带). What’s special about it is that it doesn't just rely on the dog’s vocalizations to interpret what Fido is banging on about.
Oh no C this miracle harness reads and interprets the ordinary dogs’ body language as well, giving us a full two-way dog communication experience.
Researcher David Roberts says: "Dogs communicate primarily through body language, and one of our challenges was to develop sensors that tell us about their behavior by observing their posture remotely."
Sensors on the harness monitor the dog’s heart rate and body temperature and software builds up a vocabulary, letting the human know what the dog is feeling.
What would dogs say if they could talk to us? The human can even communicate back through the harness thanks to vibration motors, supposedly by tapping into the dog’s senses so that it can understand what you’re trying to say to it.
The dog harness is designed for dogs involved in search and rescue and other front-line work, but it's got us dreaming of a beautiful future, one where humans and dogs can co-exist as equals, with the dog able to fully express itself at all times.
28. Why can’t people communicate with dogs?
A. They have difficulty understanding dogs’ barks and whimpers.?
?
B. ? They have no idea about dogs’ behavior in relation to their posture.?
??
C. ?They don’t know how to tell dogs what they want them to do.?
??
D. ??They don’t have a machine to translate the dogs’ language.
29. What does the underlined word most probably mean in paragraph two?
A. Pursue fashion.
B. Research.
C. Influence.
D. Make.
30. For what purpose is the dog harness designed?
A. . It is designed for dogs to understand what people are trying to say to them.?
??
B. It is designed to monitor the dog’s heart rate and body temperature.?
??
C. ?It is designed for dogs doing search and rescue and other front-line work.
D. Itis designed to monitor the dog’s heart rate and body temperature.?
31. What is the author’s attitude towards the possible human-dog communication?
A. ?A. Shocked.
B. Excited.
C. Embarrassed.
D. Annoyed.
D
The medical world is gradually realizing that the quality of the environment in hospitals may play a significant role in the process of recovery from illness.
As part of a nationwide effort in Britain to bring art out of the galleries and into public places, some of the country's most talented artists have been called in to transform older hospitals and to soften the hard edges of modern buildings. Of the 2,500 National Health Service hospitals in Britain, almost 100 now have significant collections of contemporary art in corridors, waiting areas and treatment rooms.
These recent initiatives owe a great deal to one artist, Peter Senior, who set up his studio at a Manchester hospital in northeastern England during the early 1970s. He felt the artist had lost his place in modern society, and that art should be enjoyed by a wider audience.
A typical hospital waiting room might have as many as 500 visitors each week. What better place to hold regular exhibitions of art? Senior held the first exhibition of his own paintings in the out-patients waiting area of the Manchester Royal Hospital in 1975. Believed to be Britain's first hospital artist, Senior was so much in demand that he was soon joined by a team of six young art school graduates.
The effect is striking. Now in the corridors and waiting rooms the visitor experiences a full view of fresh colors, playful images and restful courtyards
The quality of the environment may reduce the need for expensive drugs when a patient is recovering from an illness. A study has shown that patients who had a view onto a garden needed half the number of strong pain killers compared with patients who had no view at all or only a brick wall to look at.
32. According to the passage, "to soften the hard edges of modern buildings" means______.
A. to pull down hospital buildings
B. to decorate hospitals with art collections
C. to improve the quality of treatment in hospitals
D. to make the corners of hospital buildings round
33. According to Peter Senior, _______.
A. art is not as important in people’s daily life as in hospital
B. art galleries should be changed into hospitals
C. patients should be encouraged to learn painting
D. art should be encouraged in British hospitals
34. After the improvement of the hospital environment, _______.
A. patients no longer need expensive drugs in their recovery
B. patients are less dependent on expensive drugs in their recovery
C. patients need good-quality drugs in their recovery
D. patients use fewer pain killers in their recovery than before
35. The fact that Senior is in great demand shows that_______.
A. Peter's enterprise is developing greatly
B. Peter Senior enjoys great popularity
C. he is a talented hospital artist
D. the role of hospital environment is being recognized
