阅读下列短文，从每题所给的四个选项（A、B、C、和D）中，选出最佳选项，并在答题卡上将该项涂黑。
A
　I got invited to go with some friends to a game at another ? school. A senior will be driving us, and I think she’s a good ? driver, but it’s someone my parents don’t know. I want to tell ?my parents where I’m going, but what if I ask and they say ? “no”? I’ll end up wishing I never mentioned it and just went ?ahead and did it anyway.
?
　　If you want more privileges, it’s best to build a track record of honesty and trust. Letting a parent know where you’re going is always a good idea.
　　You may worry that telling your parents puts you at risk of getting “no” for an answer. But there’s a good chance your parents might be OK with you going. If you go but don’t tell them, ? you risk losing something more important ― your parents’ trust.
　　Parents who find out their kids did something behind their backs may be less likely to give permission to do things in the future. When trust is broken like this, parents wonder if teens are ?trying to hide something ― and what they imagine can be far worse than the reality.
　　Before you talk to your parents about the game, think about which approach will help them feel most comfortable with giving you more freedom. Maybe they’d like to meet the person ? driving or talk to friends who have driven with her in the past. If your parents have questions or ? hesitate about letting you go, find out what their worries are and then do your best to answer ?them.
1. From Paragraph 1 we know that the writer _________.
A. appears nervous
B. looks worried
C. feels confused
D. seems discouraged
2. What is the best way to get parents’ permission according to the passage?
A. To get more privileges from them.
B. To risk gaining their permission.
C. To keep off the track of reality.
D. To be honest and win their trust.
3. What does the writer really want to tell us?
A. How to win over parents.
B. How to deal with strict parents.
C. Which effective approach to use.
D. How to get freedom from parents.
4. Who do you think the passage is intended for?
A. Parents.
B. Friends.
C. Drivers.
D. Teenagers.
B
　　What are you feeling right now as you start to read this? Are you curious? Hope that you’ll learn something about yourself? Bored because this is something you have to do for school and you’re not really into it ― or happy because it’s a school project you enjoy? Perhaps you’re attracted by something else, like feeling excited about your weekend plans or sad because you just went through a breakup.
　　Emotions（情感）like these are part of human nature. They give us information about what we’re experiencing and help us know how to react. ?We sense our emotions from the time we’re babies. Young children react to their emotions ?with facial expressions or with actions like laughing or crying. They feel and show emotions, but ?they don’t yet have the ability to name the emotion or say why they feel that way.
　　As we grow up, we become more skilled in understanding emotions. Instead of just reacting like little kids do, we can identify what we feel and put it into words. With time and practice, we ?get better at knowing what we are feeling and why. This skill is called emotional awareness.
　　Emotional awareness helps us know what we need and want, or don’t want! It helps us ?build better relationships. That’s because being aware of our emotions can help us talk about feelings more clearly, avoid or settle conflicts better, and move past difficult feelings more easily. ?Some people are naturally more in touch with their emotions than others. The good news is that everyone can be more aware of their emotions. It just takes practice. But it’s worth the effort.
　　Emotional awareness is the first step toward building emotional intelligence, a skill that can help people succeed in life.
5. What can we learn from Paragraph 1?
A. Types of emotions.
B. The topic to discuss.
C. Part of human nature.
D. Ways to react to things.
6. How do young children react to emotions?
A. With laughter and shouts.
B. With signs and expressions.
C. With gestures of different kinds.
D. With facial expressions and actions.
7. From the passage we know that emotional awareness actually _________.
A. enables us to live in society more easily
B. lets people understand others better
C. brings about conflicts between people
D. smooths away difficulties in our life
8. Where is the passage probably taken from?
A. A science fiction.
B. An advertisement.
C. A science magazine.
D. A television show.
C
　　Though for many of us the year ahead may look pretty depressing, 2016 promises one great breakthrough ― a major step toward ending Africa’s particular and backward form of the great Digital Divide.
　　Poor connectivity has bedeviled much of the continent’s internet access but now a huge improvement is coming. It’s a new sub-sea cable, to be laid off Africa’s eastern coastline, ?enabling a reliable and affordable international connectivity service to both coastal and landlocked countries in Eastern, Central and Southern Africa.
　　The project is being developed by Liquid Sea, an offshore branch of Liquid Telecom, which already runs a pan-African network based on land cable supported by satellite links for rural and remote areas. Altogether, with offices from South Africa and Botswana in the south to Kenya in the East, taking in Democratic Republic of Congo in the center, it makes up the continent’s largest single connecting network crossing multiple national borders.
　　Africa has benefited in many ways from the digital revolution, but internet coverage still differs from place to place.[
　　And the unpleasant truth is that, despite some great advance in African development over the last decade and more, its effects are unequal and taken as a whole, less than 16 percent of Africans have access to the Internet, which compares that with 63 percent of Europeans and 79 percent of North Americans.
　　It’s obvious what a disadvantage is placed upon Africans by such digital inequality. The economics of the entire process is skewed（歪的）by poor network performance in Africa, with the total bandwidth available to shuttle data back and forth between African countries and the rest of the world amounting to less than 1 terabit per second. That’s about one-seventieth of Europe’s international bandwidth capacity（容量）.
　　Now Liquid Sea’s underwater cable stretching from eastern South Africa to the Middle East, ?with onward connections to Europe, aims to contribute much more in building Africa’s better connected digital future.
9. What does “bedeviled” most probably mean in Paragraph2?
A. attracted
B. troubled
C. worsened
D. contributed
10. What would the Internet be like in Africa in the future?
A. Dependable and inexpensive .
B. Accessible and comfortable.
C. Central and controllable.
D. Possible and comparable.
11. What is implied in the passage?
A. International bandwidth capacity makes no difference.
B. Internet connections improve the equality in Africa.
C. Poor internet access limits the economy of Africa.
D. Africa is now far beyond developed countries.
12. Which of the following is the best title for the passage?
A. Unsafe Internet access in Africa
B. Digital-gap narrowing in Africa
C. Bandwidth available in Africa
D. Great Digital Divide in Africa
D
　　Here are some of the best TV shows in Britain, on Wednesday, February 17th, 2016.
　
　
13. What kind of person is Mary Portas？
A. A woman of big trouble.
B. A woman of new fashion.
C. A woman with great love.
D. A woman with strong determination.
14. The on-going drama Dickensian is pieced together by _________.
A. Tony Jordan’s novel opinion
B. Charles Dickens’s books[
C. Inspect Bucket’s murder charge
D. Stephen Rea’s particular treat
15. What can be concluded from “Three Days of Terror”?
A. The survivors will no longer live in Paris.
B. Cartoons are not to be drawn in the magazine.
C. Islamist fanatics may commit more crimes.
D. The witnesses helped catch the killers.

Dear Sir/Madam,
　　I am a student from China and plan to learn English in Lancaster University for 6 months. I am writing in response to your advertisement. Here are a few things I’d like to clarify.
　　Firstly, how can I get to the University from my host home? Secondly, would I have a separate room of my own? And are there any children in the family? It would be beneficial if I have someone of a similar age living with me. Also I’s like to know if they have any special customs. Lastly, I wonder what is included within the fees in the ad, and whether it should be paid monthly or weekly.
　　I look forward to hearing from you.
　　Yours sincerely,
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Li Hua
