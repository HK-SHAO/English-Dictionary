A I sat with my friend in a well known coffee shop in a neighboring town of Venice As we enjoyed our coffee a man called the waiter and placed his order Two cups of coffee one on the wall We got interested and observed that he was served with one cup of coffee but he paid for two As soon as he left the waiter attached a piece of paper to the wall saying A Cup of Coffee Similar occasions took place twice while we were there It seemed that this gesture was quite normal at this place However it was something unique and confusing for us After a few days when we again enjoyed coffee there a man entered The way this man was dressed did not match the standard or the atmosphere of this coffee shop Poverty was evident from his looks As he seated himself he looked at the wall and said One cup of coffee from the wall The waiter served coffee to this man with respect and dignity The man had his coffee and left without paying We were amazed to watch all this when the waiter took off a piece of paper from the wall and threw it in the dustbin Now it was no surprise for us the matter was very clear The great respect for the needy shown by people in this town moved us to tears Coffee is not a necessity However the point is that when we take pleasure in any blessing maybe we also need to think about those people who also appreciate that specific blessing but cannot afford Note the waiter who gets the communication going between the affording and the needy with a smile on his face Think about the man in need he enters the coffee shop without having to lower his self dignity he has a free cup of coffee without asking or knowing about who has given this cup of coffee to him he only looked at the wall placed an order for himself enjoyed his coffee and left Besides we need to remember the role played by the wall that reflects the generosity and care of people in this town What made the author interested as well as confused A The waiter s making normal gestures B Customers buying coffee for the needy C The waiter s attaching coffee orders on the wall D Customers paying for coffee and having it put on the wall The author thought the man in need was A obviously poor B not properly dressed C not right to leave without paying D strange to order coffee from the wall In the author s opinion coffee is A necessary in our life B a blessing some can t afford C respect shown

myself in a hall in New York City sitting by my mother not at all tired although we had flown the day before and driven five hours to the city for An Evening with Harry Carrie and Garp a charity event with readings by three authors The excitement rushing through me kept me awake and thinking I was standing and applauding a woman as she prepared to read The Harry Potter series was my gateway to my academic adolescence I was so fascinated by the magic world that my mother began taking me to academic conferences focused on the books Since I have attended presentations about the Latin origin of terms and spells the ancient tales and the idea of magic These books opened my eyes to the whole world and to knowledge itself They kept my brain working over the summers More importantly they helped me adopt the ideas useful in school and beyond that there is always another way to do something or to understand an issue With uncertainty and doubt come creative ideas and new ways to look at problems that may result in new different faster and easier solutions And all this came from a little magic from a book that many people see as a series for children I also attended lectures about Ms Rowling s ability to beautifully write the story with every small detail connected to something else for example details in books by Jonathan Swift to Chaucer to Dickens and Austin I learned that like all great books Rowling s stories encouraged a connection across mind body and soul Although the series has been criticized by those who believe it encourages bad behavior in children I was able to hear discussions by those who claimed that these books teach wonderful messages if one gets its deeper meaning It is my generation s shared text all college freshmen are familiar with the stories and that gives us a set of common beliefs and ideas that help us start to learn new things What did the author do on the night of August A He flew for a charity event B He drove tiredly back home C He listened to readings by some authors D He enjoyed the excitement of driving The Harry Potter books led the author to A getting jobs in summers B studying harder in school C writing books for children D viewing things in new ways From the lectures the author knew more about A story writing skills B Rowling s life stories C criticism against books D great authors in history What can we know about the author A She decides to write similar stories B She intends to go to major in writing C She doesn t have her family s support D She may continue to read magic stories D During these past few days I have been reflecting a lot on everything that happened this past year and thinking of what I can do differently so that the coming year will be much better Here I want to share some tips so you can also do your resolution and you can achieve them all Be realistic You should always try to reach for the skies with your goals but things like I want to win the lottery or I want to lose pounds in month are things you shouldn t have on your list because they will only become frustrations Be detailed It s a lot easier to accomplish more specific plans than general ones Instead of writing I want to lose weight put things like I will start my Yes You Can Diet Plan the first Monday of the year or I will start a movement routine times a week for minutes When we put down concrete activities we ourselves to them and it becomes a lot harder to come up with excuses Think of alternatives At the beginning of this past year you put that you were going to start going to the gym as one of your annual plans During the whole year you intended to take action but you always said that you couldn t because you came home so tired from work If this is one of your plans for this year you should write down how you re going to achieve it For example I will start going to the gym in the mornings before work That way you prevent what stopped you from achieving your goal last year Focus on goals which depend on YOU It is very important that all of your plans are for YOU to accomplish and it is important that you write them down that way If one of your goals this coming year is to improve a relationship with one of your family members make sure that you clearly put down what you are going to do for this to succeed For example I will call my sister at least three times a week and I will visit her in the middle of the year Well I hope that you use these tips so that this year you will accomplish everything you want and make it the best year ever Thank you for being with me during everything this past year and I hope that you keep showing me all of this love and support during the next Happy new year Why isn t I want to win the lottery recommended as a New Year plan A Because it is very likely to fail B Because it is too easy to realize C Because it is not big enough as a goal D Because it is not easier than losing weight The underlined word commit in Paragraph can be replaced by the word A devote B determine C adjust D force When you failed to accomplish your plan last year you re advised to A take action instead of writing it down B give up the same plan this year C put down the way to realize it D stop making any plans According to the passage which of the following is the best plan A I will become a millionaire in one month B I want to be the champion of the marathon C I will change all of my bad habits in one week D I will go for a walk after supper in working days Hours a Year Like you all my email goes into my Sent Mailbox just sitting there if I want to check back at what I said to whom years ago So what a surprise to see that I send approximately emails each year roughly a day Assuming minutes per email that s about hours a year on email alone I ve been on email since the early s The answer is both yes and no Yes I have been able to keep in touch with family friends and colleagues in far away corners of the planet with ease But while these undoubted benefits are the reasons why I continue to email it is not without its own cost Most importantly as the above analysis shows email eats my time just as it likely eats yours Each time a message arrives there s just the chance that it might contain something exciting something new something special a new opportunity That s just enough to keep me checking my Inbox But that means perhaps only of the hours I spent on emails this year were actually wanted Frequent emailmessages will certainly affect our real work Like other potentialaddictions we should perhaps attempt to check the email box at certain times ofthe day or by creating email free zones by turning off Wi Fi Now I need tothink whether I really want to be spending hours a year on email at theexpense of more valuable activities A Was that time well spent B All this feeds my continued use of email C Do you spend hours on emailsevery year D And we allrecognize that email has its addictive side E Email uses technology to communicate a digital message over theInternet F Maybe one in emails contain something I really want to know or hear about G Becoming aware of what email isdoing to our allocation of

gathered his soldiers and trained them carefully At last they beat the enemy and drove them out of their country It is reported that thirty cellphones taken away by teachers during the examination and were smashed in front of students and parents at a high school As to this we hold a heated discussion the other day There are two different viewpoints about them Some think it necessarily Firstly with cellphones students would have focused their attention on studying instead of wasting their precious time reading junk message Secondly the examination will be fair if no one cheats by using cellphones However the others don t think so For one thing at the age of information cellphones have become a necessity For another students can use cellphones for study Personal speaking even if some students use cellphones for no good reason we should educate them more than destroy cellphones in such an extreme way A B C D Even as I write this story I am still smiling The past few weeks have been
