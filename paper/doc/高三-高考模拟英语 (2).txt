????????Questioningthe existence of aliens is something that scientists have done for decades. Infact, most people do believe that aliens exist in some fashion. The mainnecessities for life are water and some form of energy source. Notsurprisingly, there are some planets, exoplanets and moons that fit the bill.Here are several best chances at finding life in the universe.
????????◆TRAPPIST-1
????????TRAPPIST-1is a planetary system a few dozen light-years away, whose discovery wasannounced in early 2017. This system consists of seven Earth-like exoplanetsorbiting an "ultra-cool" star, and it is one of our shots at findingpossible life beyond our own solar system.?
????????◆Titan
????????Titanis the largest moon of Saturn, the sixth planet from our Sun. This moon couldpotentially harbor life but possibly not in the sense that we think. Titan doesnot exactly fit the description of being in a typical habitable zone.
????????Titanhas water, and it has liquid. It just doesn't have liquid water. The water onthis moon is completely solid because of the extremely cold temperature.
????????◆Europa
????????Europais one of Jupiter's moons here in our own solar system. It is another candidatedue to its potential to hold liquid water. Europa is thought to have all thenecessities for life including water, energy sources, and the right chemicalbuild-up.
????????◆Mars
????????TheRed Planet, the fourth from the Sun, is probably one of the most talked-aboutpotential candidates for extraterrestrial(地球外的) life and even for humancolonization. Despite some different voices, finding extraterrestrial life onMars really is a serious possibility.
????????Weknow by now that we won't find little green men or any intelligent form of lifethat we understand. However, there is evidence that there was and may still bemicroscopic life on the small red planet.
The common point of these celestial bodies is that _______.
A. solid water exists on them respectively
B. life might exist on each of them
C. they all contain liquid water
D. each of them has living things on it

????????About a month after I joined Facebook, I got a call fromLori Goler, a highly regarded senior director of marketing at eBay. She made itclear this was a business call. “I want to apply to work with you at Facebook,”she said. “Instead of recommending myself, I want to ask you: What is yourbiggest problem, and how can I solve it?”
??? ????My jaw hit the floor. I had hired thousandsof people over the previous decade and no one had ever said anything remotelylike that. People usually focus on finding the right role for themselves, withthe implication that their skills will help the company. Lori put Facebook’sneeds front and center. It was a killer approach. I responded, “Recruiting ismy biggest problem. And, yes, you can solve it.”
??? ????Lori never dreamed she would work inrecruiting, but she jumped in. She even agreed to trade earnings for acquiringnew skills in a new field. Lori did a great job running recruiting and withinmonths was promoted to her current job, leading People@Facebook.
??? ????The most common metaphor for careers is aladder, but this concept no longer applies to most workers. As of 2010, theaverage American had eleven jobs from the ages of eighteen to forty-six alone.Lori often quotes Pattie Sellers, who came up with a much better metaphor:“Careers are a jungle gym, not a ladder.”
??? ????As Lori describes it, there’s only one wayto get to the top of a ladder, but there are many ways to get to the top of ajungle gym. The jungle gym model benefits everyone, but especially women whomight be starting careers, switching careers, getting blocked by externalbarriers, or reentering the workforce after taking time off. The ability tocreate a unique path with occasional dips, detours (弯路), and even dead ends presents greatviews of many people, not just those at the top. On a ladder, most climbers arestuck staring at the butt of the person above.
Why did Lori make the call?
A. She helped Facebook to solve the biggest problem.
B. She wanted to make a business deal with Facebook.
C. She tried to ask for a pay rise in Facebook.
D. She wanted to become an employee in Facebook.

????????NEW YORK－A massive winter storm paralyzed much of the US East Coast on Thursday and Friday, dumping as much as 46 centimeters of snow from the Carolinas to Maine.

????????Airlines canceled 4,000 flights on Thursday and hundreds more on Friday, according to FlightAware.com, an online tracking service.
????????Mayor Bill de Blasio said it could feel like -30℃ on Friday and Saturday nights with the wind chill. "This is a serious, serious storm, and may be the most severe in 2018," he said at a news conference.
