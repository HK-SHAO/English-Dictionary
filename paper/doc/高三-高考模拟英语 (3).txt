????I set out to help clean up the beach after a violent storm a year ago. The sight I saw was heartbreaking. The broken houses seemed to be weeping quietly. I couldn’t describe how I felt. But something special among the debris (废墟) turned my day around.
????I joined a club to clean up the beach after the storm last November. As I removed the debris from the beach, I noticed an object with shiny buttons in the wet sand. It was a jacket, and I was excited since Halloween was coming and I thought I had found a great costume. After picking it up, I was able to see that the jacket was from West Point (西点军校), the United States Military Academy, and it had the name “deGavre” written inside. I realized the jacket might be important to someone. I decided to find the jacket’s owner and return it.
????I called the West Point Museum, considering that if the family couldn’t be found, the jacket should go there. The museum connected me with Kim McDermott, Director of Communications for the Academy’s Association of Graduates. Kim soon ensured that the jacket had belonged to Chester Braddock deGavre, who was a 1933 graduate and a war hero, but passed away in 1993.
????I sent Kim a photo of the jacket and she posted it to the West Point Association of Graduates Facebook Page, asking if anyone could help us find the family. In less than two hours, someone had found and called the hero’s wife, Teresa. Soon I started to receive personal messages from members of the deGavre family, their friends and others who were touched by the story and they found me on Facebook.
????Finding Chester deGavre’s jacket and connecting to his family with the help of Facebook have been so meaningful to me. I’ve formed a bond with amazing people I might have never met.
Seeing the sight after the storm, the author felt very ________．
A. sad
B. surprised
C. nervous
D. disappointed

????The human body is designed to move. But modern lifestyles and office jobs rarely give us the chance to move around. As we know, we’re sitting while we’re eating; we sit in the car and we sit while we watch TV. And many of us sit for many hours at work.
????New research shows that sitting less than three hours a day might extend your life by two years. Peter Katzmarzyk, a scientist at the University of Louisiana in the southern United States, says that sitting is ____ in our lives, meaning it is something we do all the time, everywhere.
????However, Mr. Katzmarzyk says that does not mean you can sit for the rest of your waking hours. He also says you may exercise often, “We can’t throw away physical activity. It’s extremely important. We have 60 years of research showing us that.”
????Mr. Katzmarzyk and his colleagues are part of a new generation of researchers studying how sitting all day affects length of life. “Studies that have assessed the relationship between sitting and mortality (死亡率) or television viewing and mortality are very rare. There’s only been a few of them, actually five or six now, in the last four or five years.” They found that cutting television time to less than two hours a day could add one point four years to life.
????Luckily, change is already coming to some offices, especially in the design of desks. A “standing desk” lets people stand while they work. Another new design is called the “treadmill desk.” A treadmill is an exercise machine that lets you walk in one place. Even some U.S. schools are beginning to experiment with desks that are part bicycle to keep children moving. That’s one of the strategies that many companies are using now.
????Mr. Katzmarzyk also says studying this problem has inspired his team to make a few changes in their own lives.
The underlined word “____” is closest in meaning to ________．
A. dangerous
B. awkward
C. comfortable
D. common

????Crying is the sign of the rawest of human emotions. We cry when we can’t hold inside what we feel any more. We cry when we’re at our best, and when we’re at our worst. By we, I mean all of us -- men included.
????But we never see other men cry. In no western culture has it ever been acceptable for men to shed (流泪) more than a single tear, and even then it’s reserved for grand victories, defeats and deaths. Dutch research suggests that women cry between three and five times more than men. Generally men and women cry over the same things -- deaths, break-ups and homesickness, primarily, but researchers believe that men cry more often than women when it comes to positive events.
????I want to admit，I’m a bit of a cryer. However, having never really experienced deaths in my life, a few weeks ago I experienced what it means to really, truly, pour my heart out in tears.
????See, my dog -- a loyal companion -- was killed by a car right outside my house. Being a witness to this painful event left me in shock for a good hour, but then the floodgates opened. Over the next 48 hours, I might have cried 20 times. Once or twice I crouched (蹲) on the floor with my head in my hands and tears were the only outlet.
????It is suggested in the book Adult Crying: A Biopsychosocial Approach that there’s a certain pleasure in crying.?It helps ease stress when there is no other way to express ourselves.
????In those days after my dog’s death, I remember thinking, “I’ve got to stop this crying”. It felt unmanly. It felt like a sign of weakness. I’ve since realized that tears are for everybody; they’re not gender-specific. They show we have sympathy, allow us to get rid of stress and just feel.
What does the first paragraph mainly talk about?
A. Crying is a raw human emotion.
B. Crying is an emotion beyond control.
C. Crying is an emotion showing sadness.
D. Crying is an emotion showing happiness.
