????There is a popular belief amongparents that schools are no longer interested in spelling. No school I havetaught in has ever ignored spelling or considered it unimportant as a basicskill. There are, however, vastly different ideas about how to teach it, or howmuch priority（优先）it must be given over generallanguage development and writing ability. The problem is, how to encourage achild to express himself freely and confidently in writing without holding himback with the complexities（复杂）of spelling.
?? If spelling becomes the only focal point ofhis teacher’s interest, clearly a bright child will be likely to “play safe”.He will tend to write only words within his spelling range, choosing to avoidadventurous language. That’s why teachers often encourage the early use ofdictionaries and pay attention to content rather than technical ability.
?? I was once shocked to read on the bottom ofa sensitive piece of writing about a personal experience: “ This work isterrible! There are far too many spelling errors and your writing is illegible（难以辨认的）.” It may have been a sharp criticism of the pupil’s technicalabilities in writing, but it was also a sad reflection on the teacher who hadomitted to read the essay, which contained some beautiful expressions of thechild’s deep feelings. The teacher was not wrong to draw attention to theerrors, but if his priorities had centered on the child’s ideas, an expressionof his disappointment with the presentation would have given the pupil moremotivation（动力）to seek improvement.
Teachers are different in their opinions about ___________.
A. the difficulties in teaching spelling
B. the role of spelling in general language development
C. the complexities of the basic writing skills
D. the necessity of teaching spelling

????Of all the areas of learning the most important is the developmentof attitudes. Emotional reactions as well as logical thought processes affectthe behavior of most people.
?? “Theburnt child fears the fire” is one instance; another is the rise of figureslike Hitler. Both these examples point up the fact that attitudes come fromexperience. In the one case the experience was direct and impressive; in theother it was indirect and gradual.
??The classroom teacher in the elementary school is in strategic positionto influence attitudes. This is true partly because children acquire attitudesfrom those adults whose word they respect.
??Another reason it is true is that pupils often search somewhat deeplyinto a subject in school that has only been touched upon at home or haspossibly never occurred to them before. To a child who has previously acquirelittle knowledge of Mexico, his teacher’s method of handling such a unit wouldgreatly affect his attitude toward Mexicans.
??The teacher can develop proper attitudes through social studies, sciencematters, the very atmosphere of the classroom, etc. However, when children cometo school with undesirable attitudes, it is unwise to attempt to change theirfeelings by criticizing them. The teacher can achieve the proper effect byhelping them obtain constructive experience.
?? Toillustrate, first-grade pupils, afraid of policemen will probably change theirattitudes after a classroom talk with the neighborhood officer in which heexplains how he protects them. In the same way, a class of older children candevelop attitudes through discussion, research, outside reading and all-daytrips.
??Finally, a teacher must constantly evaluate her own attitudes, becauseher influence can be harmful she has personal prejudices. This is especiallytrue in respect to controversial issues and questions of which children shouldbe encouraged to reach their own decisions as result of objective analysis ofall the facts.

?? A year after graduation, I was offered aposition teaching a writing class. Teaching was a profession I had neverseriously considered, though several of my stories had been published. Iaccepted the job without hesitation, as it would allow me to wear a tie and goby the name of Mr. Davis. My father went by the same name, and I liked toimagine people getting the two of us confused. “Wait a minute,” someone mightsay, “are talking about Mr. Davis the retired man, or Mr. Davis the respectablescholar?”
?? The position was offered at the last minute,and I was given two week to prepare, a period I spent searching for a briefcaseand standing before my full-length mirror, repeating the words, “Hello, class, I’mMr. Davis.” Sometimes I would give myself an aggressive voice. Sometimes Iwould sound experienced. But when the day eventually came, my nerves kicked inand the true Mr. Davis was there. I sounded not like a thoughtful professor,but rather a 12-year-old boy.
?? I arrived in the classroom with paper cardsdesigned in the shape of maple leaves. I had cut them myself out of orangeconstruction paper. I saw nine students along a long table. I handed out thecards, and the students wrote down their names and fastened them to theirbreast pockets as I required.
?? “All right then,” I said. “Okay, here we go.”Then I opened my briefcase and realized that I had never thought beyond thismoment. I had been thinking that the students would be the first to talk,offering their thoughts and opinions on the events of the day. I had imaginedthat I would sit on the edge of the desk, overlooking a forest of raised hands.Every student would shout to be heard, and I would knock on something in orderto silence them. I would yell, “Calm down, you’ll all get your turn. One at atime, one at a time!”
?? A terrible silence ruled the room, andseeing no other opinions, I instructed the students to pull out their notebooksand write a brief essay related to the theme of deep disappointment.

?? It has been found that less than one shopperin five makes a complete shopping list before going to the store. The reasonfor this is that seven out of ten of today’s purchases(购买)are decided in the store, where the shoppers tend toward impulse(冲动)buying. Buying groceries on impulse had risen for the past forty years, andthis rise has coincided(巧合) with the growth of self-serviceshopping. However, in grocery stores where clerks wait on customers there ismuch less impulse buying. It is hard for people to buy on impulse if they haveto address a clerk.
?? Psychologists have joined forces withmerchandising(商品) experts. It is their job topersuade people to buy products which they may not need or even want until theysee them attractively presented. It was discovered by the psychologists thatshoppers want help in their purchases. Having so many choices confuses them,and they prefer the package that attracts them. Therefore, it is now more usualfor food packers to pay attention to their package design. Attraction dependsheavily on the position of the product on the shelf, however. Thus, persuadingthe shopper to buy is easier if the product is located at eye-level.
According to the information in the first paragraph, ______ make a complete list.
A. only five shoppers
B. less than twenty percent of the shoppers
C. only ten percent of the shoppers
D. not even five percent of the shoppers

C. people tend to decide on buying products when they see them

????[1] A healthy weight is a weight that lowers your risk for health problems. For most people, body mass index (BMI) and waist size are good ways to tell if they are at a healthy weight.
????[2] If you want to get to a healthy weight and stay there, a healthy lifestyle will work better than dieting. Reaching a certain number on the scale is not as important as having a healthy lifestyle.
????[3] Staying at a healthy weight is one of the best things you can do for your health. It can help prevent serious problems, including: heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes and sleep apnea.
????[4] But weight is only _________. Even if you carry some extra weight, eating healthy foods and being more active can help you feel better, have more energy, and lower your risk for disease
????[5] If you decide that you do need to make some changes, here are three steps to reach a healthy weight:
????[6] Improve your eating habits. Do it slowly. You may be tempted to do a diet overhaul and change everything about the way you eat. But you will be more successful at staying with the changes you make if you pick just one eating habit at a time to work on.
????[7] Get moving: Try to make physical activity a regular part of your day, just like brushing your teeth.
????[8] Changing your thinking. Our thoughts have a lot to do with how we feel and what we do. If you can stop your brain from telling you discouraging things and have it start encouraging you instead, you may be surprised at?how much healthier you’ll be in mind and body.

One possible version:
????????It is well-known that the task of students is to study, so some students regard that marks are very important. They think that their primary task is to study and learn from teachers and textbooks. They seldom take part in other activities, for they are afraid that those activities will affect their study. They put marks in the first place, thus neglecting the development of practical abilities.
????????However, some other students think it most important to develop one’s own practical ability. They think that students should not only learn the textbook knowledge, what’s more, they should also learn from outside the textbooks. They think one’s own practical ability is of primary importance. So they take the chance to develop their own practical ability seriously.
????????In my opinion, we should first study hard, but we should not neglect our own practical ability, for when we enter the society, we need various abilities. Without practice, it is hard for us to be useful for the society.
