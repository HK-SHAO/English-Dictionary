Many of us love July because it's the month when nature's berries and stone fruits are in abundance. These colourful and sweet jewels from British Columbia's fields are little powerhouses of nutritional protection.
Of the common berries, strawberries are highest in vitamin C, although, because of their seeds, raspberries contain a little more protein (蛋白质)， iron and zinc（not that fruits have much protein). Blueberries are particularly high in antioxidants(抗氧化物质). The yellow and orange stone fruits such as peaches are high in the carotenoids we turn into vitamin A and which are antioxidants, As for cherries (樱花). they are so delicious who cares? However ,they are rich in vitamin C.
When combined with berries or slices of other fruits. frozen bananas make an excellent base for thick, cooling fruit shakes and low fat “ice cream”. For this purpose, select ripe bananas for freezing as they are much sweeter. Remove the skin and place them in plastic bags or containers and freeze If you like, a squeeze of fresh lemon juice on the bananas will prevent them turning brown. Frozen bananas will last several weeks, depending on their ripeness and the temperature of the freezer.
If you have a juicer, you can simply feed in frozen bananas and some berries or sliced fruit. Out comes a“soft-serve” creamy dessert, to be eaten right away. This makes a fun activity for a children's party； they love feeding the fruit and frozen bananas into the top of the machine and watching the ice cream come out below.

Teens and younger children are reading a lot less for fun, according to a Common Sense Media report published Monday.
While the decline over the past decade is steep for teen readers, some data in the report shows that reading remains a big part of many children's lives, and indicates how parents might help encourage more reading.
According to the report's key findings, “the proportion(比例) who say they‘hardly ever’read for fun has gone from 8 percent of 13-year-olds and 9 percent of 17-year-olds in 1984 to 22 percent and 27 percent respectively today.”
The report data shows that pleasure reading levels for younger children. ages 2-8, remain largely the same. But the amount of time spent in reading each session has declined, from closer to an hour or more to closer to a half hour per session.
When it comes to technology and reading，the report does little to counsel (建议) parents looking for data about the effect of e-readers and tablets on reading. It does point out that many parents still limit electronic reading, mainly due to concerns about increased screen time.
The most hopeful data shared in the report shows clear evidence of parents serving as examples and important guides for their kids when it comes to reading, Data shows that kids and teens who do read frequently, compared to infrequent readers, have more books in the home, more books purchased for them, parents who read more often, and parents who set aside time for them to read.
As the end of school approaches, and school vacation reading lists loom (逼近) ahead ,parents might take this chance to step in and make their own summer reading list and plan a family trip to the library or bookstore.
28. What is the Common Sense Media report probably about?
A. Children’s reading habits.
B. Quality of children's books.
C. Children’s after-class activities.
D. parent-child relationships.
29. Where can you find the data that best supports“children are reading a lot less for fun”?
A. In paragraph 2.
B. In paragraph 3.
C. In paragraph 4
D. In paragraph 5.
30. Why do many parents limit electronic reading?
A. E-books are of poor quality.
B. It could be a waste of time.
C. It may harm children’s health.
D. E-readers are expensive.
31. How should parents encourage their children to read more?
A. Act as role models for them
B. Ask them to write book reports
C. Set up reading groups for them
D. Talk with their reading class teachers
D
We've all been there: in a lift, in line at the bank or on an airplane, surrounded by people who are, like us, deeply focused on their smartphones or, worse, struggling with the uncomfortable silence.
What's the problem? It's possible that we all have compromised conversational intelligence. It's more likely that none of us start a conversation because it's awkward and challenging, or we think it's annoying and unnecessary. But the next time you find yourself among strangers, consider that small talk is worth the trouble .Experts say it's an invaluable social practice that results in big benefits.
Dismissing small talk as unimportant is easy, but we can't forget that deep relationships wouldn't even exist if it weren't for casual conversation. Small talk is the grease (润滑剂)for social communication, says Bernardo Carducci, director of the Shyness Research Institute at Indiana University Southeast ."Almost every great love story and each big business deal begins with small talk, "he explains. "The key to successful small talk is learning how to connect with others, not just communicate with them.”
In a 2014 study, Elizabeth Dunn, associate professor of psychology at UBC, invited people on their way into a coffee shop. One group was asked to seek out an interaction(互动) with its waiter, the other, to speak only when necessary. The results showed that those who chatted with their server reported significantly higher positive feelings and a better coffee shop experience. "it's not that talking to the waiter is better than talking to your husband.”says Dunn ."But interactions with peripheral (边缘的)members of our social network matter for our well-being also.”
Dunn believes that people who reach out to strangers feel a significantly greater sense of belonging, a bond with others. Carducci believes developing such a sense of belonging starts with small talk. "Small talk is the basis of good manners, ”he says.
32. What phenomenon is described in the first paragraph?
A. Addiction to smartphones
B. Inappropriate behaviours in public places
C. Absence of communication between strangers.
D. Impatience with slow service
33. What is important for successful small talk according to Carducci?
A. Showing good manners.
B. Relating to other people.
C. Focusing on a topic.
D. Making business deals
34. What does the coffee-shop study suggest about small talk?
A. It improves family relationships.
B. It raises people's confidence.
C. It matters as much as a formal talk.
D. It makes people feel good.
35. What is the best title for the text?
A. Conversation Counts
B. Ways of Making Small Talk
C. Benefits of Small Talk
D. Uncomfortable Silence
