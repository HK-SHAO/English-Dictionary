I had one trip last year where I was caught by a hurricane in America. I picked up the stem cells in Providence, Rhode Island, and was meant to fly to Washington then back to London. But when I arrived at the check-in desk at Providence, the lady on the desk said:”Well, I’m really sorry, I’ve got some bad news for you-there are no fights from Washington.”So I took my box and put it on the desk and I said:”In this box are some stem cells that are urgently needed for a patient-please, please, you’ve got to get me back to the United Kingdom.”She just dropped everything. She arranged for a flight on a small? plance to be held for me.re-routed(改道)me through Newark and got me back to the UK even earlier than originally scheduled.
For this courier job, you’re consciously aware than that box you’re got something that is potentially going to save somebody’s life.

The?meaning?of?silence?varies?among?cultural?groups.?Silences?may?be?thoughtful,?or?they?may?be?empty?when?a?person?has?nothing?to?say.?A?silence?in?a?conversation?may?also?show?stubbornness,?or?worry.?Silence?may?be?viewed?by?some?cultural?groups?as?extremely?uncomfortable;?therefore?attempts?may?be?made?to?fill?every?gap(间隙)with?conversation.?Persons?in?other?cultural?groups?value?silence?and?view?it?as?necessary?for?understanding?a?person's?needs.?
Many?Native?Americans?value?silence?and?feel?it?is?a?basic?part?of?communicating?among?people,?just?as?some?traditional?Chinese?and?Thai?persons?do.?Therefore,?when?a?person?from?one?of?these?cultures?is?speaking?and?suddenly?stops,?what?maybe?implied(暗示)?is?that?the?person wants the listener to consider what has been said before continuing. In these cultures, silence is a call for reflection.
Other cultures may use silence in other ways, particularly when dealing with conflicts among people or in relationships of people with different amounts of power. For example, Russian, French, and Spanish persons may use silence to show agreement between parties about the topic udner discussion. However, Mexicans may use silence when instructions are given by a person in authority rather than be rude to that person by arguing with him or her. In still another use, persons in Asian cultures may view silence as a sign of respect, particularly to an elder or a person in authority.
Nurses and other care-geivers need to be aware of the possible meanings of silence when they come across the personal anxiety their patients may be expericencing. Nurses should recognize their own personal and cultural construction of silence so that a patient’s silence is not interrupted too early or allowed to go on unnecessarily.

根据短文内容，从短文后的选项中选出能填入空白处的最佳选项，选项中有两项为多余选项。
Secret codes (密码)keep messages private。Banks, companies, and government agencies use secret codes in doing business, especially when information is sent by computer.
People have used secret codes for thousands of years. ____ Code breaking never lags(落后) far behind code making. The science of creating and reading coded messages is called cryptography.
There are three main types of cryptography. ____ For example, the first letters of “My elephant eats too many eels” Spell out the hidden message “Meet me.”
____ You might represent each letter with a number, For example, Let’s number the letters of the alphabet, in order, from 1 to 26. If we substitute a number for each letter, the message “Meet me” would read “13 5 20 13 5.”
A ??code uses symbols to replace words, phrases, or sentences. To read the message of a real code, you must have a code book.____For example, ”bridge“ might stand for “meet” and “out” might stand for “me.” The message “bridge out” would actually mean “Meet me.”?____However, it is also hard to keep a code book secret for long. So codes must be changed frequently.
A. It?is?very?hard?to?break?a?code?without?the?code?book.
B. In?any?language,?some?letters?are?used?more?than?others.
C. Only?people?who?know?the?keyword?can?read?the?message.
