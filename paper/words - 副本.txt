A
    Before he sailed round the world alone, Francis Chichester had already surprised his friends several times. He had tried to fly round the world but failed. That was in 1931.
    The years passed. He gave up flying and began sailing. He enjoyed it greatly. Chichester was already 58 years old when he won the first solo transatlantic sailing race. His old dream of going round the world came back, but this time he would sail.His friends and doctors did not think he could do it, as he had lung cancer. But Chichester was determined to carry out his plan. In August 1966, at the age of nearly 65, an age when many men retire, he began the greatest voyage of his life. 
    Chichester covered 14100 miles before stopping in Sydney, Australia. This was more than twice the distance anyone had previously sailed alone. He arrived in Australia on 12 December, just 107 days out from England. He received a warm welcome from the Australians and from his family who had flown there to meet him. On shore, Chichester could not walk without help. Everybody said the same thing: he had done enough; he must not go any further. But he did not listen.
    After resting in Sydney for a few weeks, Chichester set off once more in spite of his friends' attempts to dissuade him. The second half of his voyage was by far the more dangerous part, during which he sailed round the treacherous Cape Horn.After succeeding in sailing round Cape Horn, Chichester sent the following radio message to London: "I feel as if I had wakened from a nightmare. Wild horses could not drag me down to Cape Horn and that sinister Southern Ocean again."
    Just before 9 o'clock on Sunday evening 28 May 1967, he arrived back in England, where a quarter of a million people were waiting to welcome him.Queen Elizabeth II knighted(授以爵位) him with the very sword that Queen Elizabeth I had used almost 400 years earlier to knight Sir Francis Drake after he had sailed round the world for the first time.The whole voyage from England and back had covered 28,500 miles. It had taken him nine months, of which the sailing time was 226 days. He had done what he wanted to accomplish.
21.What can we learn about Chichester?
A.He failed the solo transatlantic sailing race in 1959.
B.He was a brave and determined man.
C.The second half of his voyage was not as dangerous as the first half.
D.The radio message expressed his concern about the sailing.
22.What did Queen Elizabeth II do after Chichester arrived back in England?
A.She called on the English to learn form him. 
B.She was waiting to congratulate on his success in sailing.
C.She thought poorly of his achievements.
D.She knighted him for praising him.
23.We can infer from the text that ____
A.Anyone who had sailed alone traveled less than 7050miles before 1966
B.Chichester sailed round the Atlantic in 1931
C.Most of the English retire at the age of 65
D.Chichester died of lung cancer in 1967 after he went back to England

 Banquets are usually held in restaurants in private rooms that have been reserved for the purpose. You will be met at the door and led to the banquet room. Traditionally, the head of your delegation should enter the room first. Do not be surprised if your hosts greet you with a loud round of applause. The proper response is to applaud back.
　　Seating arrangements are stricter than in the West. Guests should never assume that they may sit where they please and should wait for hosts to guide them to their places. Traditionally, the Chinese regard the right side as the superior and the left side as the inferior. Therefore on formal occasions, the host invariably arranges for the main guests to sit on his right side.
　　It is the host's responsibility to serve the guests, and at very formal banquets people do not begin to eat until the host has served a portion to the principal guest. Or, the host may simply raise his chopsticks and announce that eating has begun. After this point, one may serve oneself any food in any amount. Remember to go slow on eating. Don't fill yourself up when five courses are left to go. To stop eating in the middle of a banquet is rude, and your host may incorrectly think that something has been done to offend you.
　　Drinking takes an important place in Chinese banquets. It is likely that the host will stand and hold his glass out with both hands while saying a few words. When he says the words "gan bei", which means bottoms up, all present should drain their glasses. After this initial toast, drinking and toasting are open to all. No words are needed to make a toast, and it is not necessary to drain your glass, although to do so is more respectful. When filling another glass, it is polite to fill it as full as you can. This symbolizes full respect and friendship.
  When the last dish is finished, the banquet has officially ended. There is little ceremony involved with its conclusion. The host may ask if you have eaten your fill. Then the principal host will rise, signaling that the banquet has ended. Generally, the principal host will bid good evening to everyone at the door and stay behind to settle the bill with the restaurateur. Other hosts usually accompany guests to their vehicles and remain outside waving until the cars have left the premises.
24.To attend a formal banquet,you_______.
A.may enter the banquet room directly when you arrive .
B.may stop eating in the middle of the banquet.
C.may help yourself to any food immediately the dishes are served.
D.should applaud back when greeted with a loud round of applause .
25.What is the host ‘s responsibility in the author’s eyes?
A.Announcing that eating ends. 
B.Driving guests to their home.
C.Filling the guests’ glasses.
D.Arranging for guests to go to their place..
26.We can conclude form the passage that____
A.To stop eating halfway means that the dishes taste bad.
B.Guests should drain their g1ass es the instant they are filled
C.Important guests are arranged to sit on the host’s right side
D.The more you drink , the more you respect the host.
27.The passage mainly tells us ____
A.Chinese food is delicious.
B.customs and traditions at banquets in China
C.what food guests should eat at banquets
D.different customs between China and western countries.
C
  A machine that takes sweat-laden clothes and turns the moisture into drinking water is in use in Sweden.The device spins and heats the material to remove the sweat, and then passes the vapor through a special membrane designed to only let water molecules get through.
  Since its Monday launch, its creators say more than 1,000 people have "drunk other's sweat" in Gothenburg.They add the liquid is cleaner than local tap water.
  The device was built for the United Nation's child-focused charity UNICEF to promote a campaign highlighting the fact that 780 million people in the world lack access to clean water.
  The machine was designed and built by engineer Andreas Hammar, known locally for his appearances on TV tech show Mekatronik.He said the critical part of the sweat machine was a new water purification component developed by a company named HVR in collaboration with Sweden's Royal Institute of Technology.
  "It uses a technique called membrane distillation(膜蒸馏)," he told the BBC."We use a substance that's a bit like Gortex that only lets steam through but keeps bacteria, salts, clothing fibers and other substances out."They have something similar on the International Space Station to treat astronaut's urine - but our machine was cheaper to build.Volunteers have been sampling the treated sweat since the start of the week in Gothenburg"The amount of water it produces depends on how sweaty the person is - but one person's T-shirt typically produces 10ml , roughly a mouthful."
  The equipment has been put on show at the Gothia Cup - the world's largest international youth football tournament.MattiasRonge, chief executive of Stockholm-based advertising agency Deportivo - which organized the stunt(惊人的表演) - said the machine had helped raise awareness for UNICEF, but in reality had its limitations.
  "People haven't produced as much sweat as we hoped - right now the weather in Gothenburg is lousy," he said."So we've installed exercise bikes alongside the machine and volunteers are cycling like crazy."Even so, the demand for sweat is greater than the supply. And the machine will never be mass produced - there are better solutions out there such as water purifying pills."
28.Which of the following is the disadvantage of the machine?_______.
A.The water processed by the machine is cleaner than local tap water .
B.The amount of water the machine produces is too small.
C.the machine is cheaper than the similar one on the International Space Station
D.The machine can help raise awareness of lacking water in the world .
29.What is the main idea of the fifth paragraph ?
A.How the machine works. 				B.Who developed the machine.
C.How the machine was invented.			D.Why the machine was invented..
30.What does Mttias Ronge think of the machine?____
A.The machine can solve the severe water shortage in the world..
B.People do not like the water the machine processes
C.The machine should be used in rather hot areas in summer.
D.The machine is not worth popularizing..
31.The passage is most likely to be____
A.a tourist brochure      B.a book review		C.a news report         D.a blog.
                                       D
    Many people rely on a cup of coffee or two to wake them up in the morning or pick them up during the working day, but now a chemist has come up with a speedy alternative to crafting a cup of coffee.
    U.S. biochemist Ben Yu has created `Sprayable Energy,` which claims to be the world`s first caffeine - based topical energy spray.He said tired workers can spray a `shot` of caffeine onto their skin without experiencing a strong buzz, loading up on unnecessary calories or being stuck with a nasty aftertaste like they might get from drinking energy drinks or coffee.
    The patent-pending caffeine spray is an odourless liquid that is absorbed through the skin and distributed through the body over a number of hours to deliver a caffeine hit that apparently lasts longer than guzzling a cup of coffee.
    Each small aluminum bottle of Sprayable Energy contains around 160 sprays - the equivalent amount of caffeine to 40 cups of coffee and the creators say it is a much cheaper way of getting a caffeine fix than popping to a cafe.The only active ingredient in the spray is caffeine, which can naturally enter the human body through the skin by passing through cell membranes as it is very similar to nicotine in structure.Each spritz of Sprayable Energy contains around a quarter of the amount of caffeine found in a cup of coffee, but apparently has the same effect as a full cup.
    The website said: `The reason for this is our product not being ingested, isn`t almost entirely metabolised（新陈代谢） by the liver before entering your system and becoming available to your body.`
`Thus, a smaller amount of caffeine can have just the same effect as a very large amount of caffeine ingested through an energy drink or cup of coffee.`c`s website recommends that users apply the spray in places where they normally spritz perfume, such as the neck or wrists, but warns users not to exceed 20 sprays a day.
    It claims that after spraying the product on the skin, users will feel `awake and focused without being over-stimulated,` which is common with coffee and energy drinks.
32.What can we learn about Sprayable Energy from the passage ?_______.
A.A bottle of Sprayable Energyis cheaper than 40 cups of coffee. .
B.Sprayable Energy lets users not worry about taking in unecessary calories..
C.Sprayable Energy can be used at least 20 sprays a day
D.The caffeine spray is a colorless liquid that is absorbed through the skin..
33.What does the fifth paragraph mainly tell us ?____
A,Sprayable Energy is taken by mouth...
B.Before Sprayable Energy is absorbed by body, the liver entirely metabolizes it
C.How Sprayable Energy acts on user’s body and how users use the product.
D.Sprayable Energy is convenient but expensive.

34.We can conclude from the passage that ____
A.Sprayable Energy can not be permitted to be used by people now.
B. Sprayable Energy has not already gone into mass production
C.each spritz of Sprayable Energy has the same effect as a full cup of coffee
D.Sprayable Energy is well received by flagging workers.
35.The writer’s attitude towards Sprayable Energy ____
A.negative.           B. positive
C.uncertain           D.indifferent

                      New English Tests Are Better, but Harder 
    Scores on English tests are very important to students around the world. In order to make sure that they do their best, both students and teachers should stay informed of how these tests are changing.
    Clive Roberts is a director at ELS Educational Services, one of the companies that trains students in English. Mr. Roberts says the tests are changing greatly in response to the global growth in the use of English as a lingua franca – the common language used among people with different native languages.
    Mr. Roberts says English “is one of the keys now to international student mobility. So, for that reason, ___36___; old tests are being revamped to meet the needs of universities and employers worldwide.”
    In other words, students increasingly need English in order to study and work in other countries. So, schools and businesses are asking for more accurate tests. 
___37___
    Mr. Roberts says several parts of standardized tests have changed recently. Now, many tests are given on computers. And, he says, tests measure all four skills of language learning: reading, listening, speaking and writing.
    "A lot of are now delivered online, all four skills are being tested, in some cases, by computer, in particular speaking and writing skills, which are the most difficult to assess on a computer environment."  
 Computer testing will reduce the length of time required for testing, because the tests adjust to the test-taker’s ability. These computer-adaptive tests also increase accuracy in scoring.     Computer-adaptive tests change depending on the test-taker’s responses. They can become more or less difficult during the testing session. For this reason, the set of correct answers will be different for each test-taker. 
___38___
    Another change to language testing relates to cultural sensitivity. The term refers to material on a test that is based on a certain culture or is hard for test-takers from different cultures to understand.
    Mr. Roberts says test development companies are now hiring people with intercultural communication backgrounds to review test items. The companies want to make sure the test does not upset test-takers. Having negative feelings may affect a student's performance on the test.
___39___
    Changes to English proficiency tests make them better at measuring the learners' ability. However, Mr. Roberts says the changes may mean the tests are more difficult for some students.
    "The tests have become more proficiency-oriented. The items are being designed in such a way that they test real-world proficiency and not simply sort of an artificial environment or a specific set of skills that are taught in a classroom. So a lot of authentic texts, a lot of authentic listening passages are being used.”
    The changes mean students have to be able to understand English the way it is used in everyday life, not just in textbooks.
___40___
    Another big change is the way in which a student's performance on the tests is measured. Mr. Roberts says that many tests are measured according to the Common European Frame of Reference (CERF) scale of language proficiency.
    This measurement, Mr. Roberts says, “is similar to the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) and the Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) guidelines, which are used by American universities and government agencies, respectively.”
    The rating scales and guidelines are designed to show what the learner is able to do in the areas of speaking, reading, listening and writing.
    Mr. Roberts says, “It gives a description of what they can do with the language and then assigns a numerical value to that particular level.”
    Mr. Roberts says he believes linking the scores and the scales means the tests provide more useful information about a learner’s ability than they did before.
    In addition, changes to the tests will encourage schools to teach their students to use English for everyday life and study.
A:Cultural sensitivity
B:What the tests measure
C:a lot of new tests are being developed
D:Difficulties in language testing
E:Changes in language testing
F:new tests are being measured by some language experts
G:Accuracy in language testing

“They’re going to kick me out of my own home,” said Karl Berger, 86 years old. Karl is a widower with no living children. When Karl’s wife died a couple of years ago, he told the Social Security Administration to stop  41  monthly checks to his wife. But the agency   42   to send the checks. Karl called again; a clerk said not to   43  . He told Karl to mail a follow-up 44   that included his wife's   45   of death. But the checks continued to come. Karl needed the money,   46   he cashed his wife’s checks.
　　When SSA   47   realized its mistake, it sent Karl a letter saying that he   48   SSA $5,900 plus interest. Karl receives only $12,000 a year, which is slightly   49   poverty level. The only   50   that he ever had--$5,000--was   51   on his wife’s funeral. He fought on Iwo Jima, site of one of the most furious battles of World War II. The battle left him  52  in one ear and almost blind in one eye.
　　His small house used to be in a good neighborhood. He takes the bus once a week to visit his wife's   53  . The rest of his time is spent at home, where he carves   54   military figures that he donates to a local charity. The charity   55   the carvings and uses the money to help feed the homeless.
　　SSA gave Karl six months to pay the debt in   56  . Otherwise, the SSA letter said, the agency would seize his home. Karl wrote back, asking if it would be okay to   57   $30 a month. That was all he could   58  .
　　“That’s insufficient,” said William Shatner, an SSA agent. “We know that he is a war veteran, but that doesn’t entitle him to free   59  . He knew that his wife was dead, yet he cashed her monthly   60  . That is fraud, pure and simple.”

With the popularity of smart phones and the development of modern technology, people choose to send their best wishes through WeChat to their friends and family members on their birthdays or at festivals. Red envelopes are given to each other as lucky money or gifts.
Compared with traditional ways of expressing best wishes, giving red envelopes has many advantages. First, it creates much fun among friends and family members by gabbing red envelopes. More importantly, it’s quicker and more convenient to send and receive them, without being limited by time and space. In this way, it saves people much time especially in such a busy society.
Personally, I prefer this new kind of expressing wishes. It’s the Internet that is making our life more colorful and comfortable. Let’s just enjoy the fun of it.

She and my dad worked hard to save every penny possible.
       They saved ever7 penny to buy a farm late in life. They also saved enough money to live out their respective live with home care without taking up residency in a nursing home. They were fiercely independent.  If you had suggested they accept a government transfer payment, they
 would have spit in your eye.

       You may have heard that a young man named Abner Doubleday invented the game known as baseball in Cooperstown, New York, during the summer of 1839. Doubleday then went on to become a Civil War hero, while baseball became America's beloved national pastime. Not only is that story untrue, it's not even in the ballpark( place for baseball).Doubleday was still at West Point in 1839, and he never claimed tohave anything to do with baseball.
       In 1907, a special commission(委员会) created by the sportinggoods merchant and former major league player A. J. Spalding used weak evidence-namely the claims of one man, mining engineer Abner Graves-to come up with the Doubleday origin story. Cooperstown businessmen and major league officials would rely on the myth's lasting power in the 1930s, when they established the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in the village.
       As it turns out, the real history of baseball is a little more complicated than the Doubleday legend. References to games resembling(相似) baseball in the United States date hack to the 18th century .its most direct ancestors appear to be two English games: rounder a( a children's game brought to New England by the earliest colonists) and cricket. By the time of the American Revolution, variations(演变) of such games were being played on schoolyards and college campuses across the country. They became even more popular in newly industrialized cities wheremen sought work in the mid-19th century-.In September 1845, a group of New York City men founded the New York Knickerbocker Baseball Club .One of them would make a new set of rules that would form the basis for modern baseball.
    Cartwright's changes made the game faster-paced and more challenging from older games like cricket. In 1846, the Knickerbockers : played the first official game of baseball against a team of cricket players, beginning a new, uniquely American tradition.
 28. What can we know according to the first paragraph?               .
      A. Baseball was really invented by Abner Doubleday.
      B, Abner Doubleday fought against slaves in the Civil War.
      C. Doubleday stayed at West Point for some reason.
    D. Doubleday said he had much to do with baseball.
 29. Why did the Doubleday origin story come up?
     A. Because a special commission was founded.
    B. Because Doubleday provided false evidence.
    C. Because Abner Craves told a Doubleday story.
    D. Because Abner Craves worked with Doubleday.
 30. The real history of baseball is _____
     A. much simpler than the Doubleday legend
     B. that baseball comes from two English games
     C. that a children’s game came from New England
     D. more interesting than rounder and cricket
 31.1t can be infened from the passage that____
       A. Doubleday is the most respected in the USA
       B. Doubleday must have been an army officer
       C. Doubleday in fact came from Britain

    Let Your Child Tell the Story

    38
    In short, you need to take an active role. If you want your  children's language skills to improve, take their vocabulary questions  seriously. When they express curiosity about a word, be sure to teach the correct definition and pronunciation
    Correct Mistakes with Care
    39   However. it's essential not to scold them when they make  such mistakes. Rather, point out what they got right, and then review the proper way to use and or speak the word. The more fun and positive  an experience, the more interested and able your children will be in ex-
panding their vocabulary
    Do Be Patient
You may need to repeat words and meanings many times before  your child fully grasps the concept .This is completely nonnal__40      Children develop at their own paces .The most important thing is to honor and balance their needs so that learning doesn't become struggle.

	My wife and I have always been friendly with the clerks at the local convenience store. I don’t think many people appreciate what a difficult job these folks have. They work for a little over minimum wage and I often wonder how they make ends meet.
 	One of the clerks, Charlie, was always wearing his glasses but he didn’t one day. I asked him about it and he said they’d been out of order and that he couldn’t afford a new pair. His family needed money. It was obvious that he was having a difficult time.
	We wanted to help him, so we turned to our own eye doctor for assistance with a plan. We had his secretary contact him, asking him to come in for an eye exam for free. We told the doctor to let him order whatever glasses he wanted and that we would pay for them. Although Charlie questioned what was going on, the doctor just told him that someone had offered the money for his new glasses. When we went in to pay the bill, the doctor told us he was so touched by our idea that he waived the exam fee and only charged us for half the price of the glasses!
	It was so wonderful to see Charlie in her new glasses and he enjoyed telling all the regular customers how the gift came about. I’m sure that upon hearing her story, ideas of kindness may have emerged in the minds of many. 

24. Why didn’t the clerk Charlie wear glasses one day?
	A. It was very warm and fine.
	B. His old glasses were broken.
	C. His glasses were missing.
	D. He forgot to wear his glasses.
25. From the passage, we can infer that ________.
	A. Charlie was a young man with skills
	B. Charlie knew who paid the money for the new glasses
	C. Charlie didn’t support his family with enough money
	D. Charlie entirely accepted the money for the new glasses
26. The underlined word “waived” in the third paragraph can be replaced by ________.
A. gave up		 B. took up         C. cut down			  D. put off
27. Which of the following could be the best title for the passage?

	In America, parents tend to encourage their children to develop their potential (潜能) to the fullest extent. Fathers and mothers frequently teach their children both ambition and the confidence necessary to work toward their goals. American parents are always active in concentrating on what their kids can do, not what they can’t. As a result, millions of American boys and girls grow up hoping to become actors and athletes, diplomats and doctors. Many of them even want to become president. 
	American parents often encourage their children to become involved in extra activities of all types at school, such as student government, sports and music. They believe that only through taking part in these activities can their children become mature young adults. 
	As we all know, schoolwork is important. But parents should realize that the social skills their children learn form natural conversations with each other are as important as schoolwork and the skills they will need in the future work. What’s more important in their work is that their children should have a sound knowledge of physics or the ability to communicate effectively.
	As a rule, Chinese parents don’t educate their children about the same kind of ambition and confidence as Americans do, nor do they encourage the same level of participation in extra activities. Children are typically advised to study hard and pass exams. They have to spend a lot of time in doing much schoolwork every day. It is a great waste of time to do so.
    Now more and more Chinese parents have recognized that they should pay attention to developing the potential of their children. I hope that leaders in Chinese educational circles should take some measures to develop the potential of their children. I am very confident about it.  		

28. From the passage, we know the American parents pay much more attention to ________.
	A. the social skills than Chinese parents
	B. their children’s studying hard and well
	C. what their children want but they can’t  
	D. extra activities than schoolwork
29. According to the passage, Chinese parents ________.
	A. know more than American parents to educate their children
	B. owning ambition and confidence is necessary and important
	C. pay much more attention to their children’s fine future
	D. don’t encourage their children to participate in extra activities
30. From the passage, we can infer _______.
	A. American children are brave and adventurous
	B. American children are more active in their studies
	C. Chinese children have the ability to communicate effectively
	D. Something should be done to develop the potential of the children in China
31. What’s the writer’s attitude towards Chinese education reform?
	A. Neutral.		B. Indifferent.		C. Positive.		D. Negative.

D
	Nowadays many people are concerned about the problem of what to do with electronic waste such as old televisions, computers, radios, cellular telephones and other electronic equipment.
	Electronic trash, or e-waste, is piling up faster than ever in American homes and businesses. People do not know what to do with old televisions or computers so they throw them in the trash.
	National Solid Waste Management Association (NSWMA) state programs director Chaz Miller says the large amount of electronic waste Americans product is not unexpected.
	The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates more than 400 million consumer electronic items are dumped each year, and there is a push by more states to ban the waste from landfills (垃圾填埋场) and create recycling programs. They can be torn apart and sorted for useable parts. Mike Fannon who runs the plant in Baltimore says, “There are lots of valuable metals that can be recovered and reused instead of just putting them in the landfill, and in certain components there are some materials that should not really be in the landfill. ” 
	Fannon says nearly 20 percent of electronic waste is recycled nationwide. Thirteen years ago, it was only about 6 percent. Recycling rates continue to rise as more communities have banned electronics from landfills in order to keep e-waste poisons like lead (铅) and mercury (汞) out of garbage dumps.
	This year several states like Vermont imposed a ban on electronic waste in landfills. More than 25 other states have also adopted bans on e-waste in landfills. Chaz Miller says more can be done to boost electronic waste recycling.
	“We can do much better,” noted Miller. “I think clearly our goal should be to do as well as we do recycling newspapers.” 

32. Which of the following does NOT belong to e-waste?
	A. Old televisions.				B. Old computers.
	C. Old cell phones.				D. Old newspapers.
33. Why is e-waste banned from landfills in many states?
	A. Because it can not be recycled.
	B. Because the landfills are already full.
	C. Because it might damage the environment.
	D. Because it can be shipped to other countries.
34. According to Mike Fannon, what might be the best way of dealing with e-waste?
	A. Recycling it.				B. Selling it.
	C. Burying it.					D. Breaking it.
35. What can we learn from the passage?
	A. Chaz Miller works for EPA.
B. Miller is optimistic about the future of e-waste.
C. At present, less than 10 percent of e-waste is recycled.
	D. All states in the US have banned e-waste from landfills.

Pool Safety Tips for Kids
	On a hot summer day, there are few things that are more appealing than a nice cool pool.   36   And it is completely relaxing. Of course, if you have children, there are certain safety measures you should take, whether you have a pool in your backyard or are going to a public pool.
	Go swimming together. No person should ever swim alone. Though many people do, the simple truth is that it only takes a second to become injured or drown.   37   Having someone there with you can make the difference between life and death. This is especially true for young children. If your child is under the age of 5, you should never allow them to swim out of arm’s length.
      38   Kids love to chase one another through the water. But it is important that you emphasize to your children that at no time should they be running around the pool or pushing anyone. In the water, teach children not to jump on top of one another and to watch their surroundings, so that they do not accidentally knock into others, injuring them. Playing around in the pool is very interesting but dangerous.
	Keep it locked. If you own a pool, you must have a locking gate around your pool.   39   Keep the gate locked at all times, even when you are physically in the pool. It is terrible for children to steal into the pool.	
Know the way out.   40   Make sure that they know where all ladders are, and that you teach them to use them for entering and exiting the pool safely. Although your child may be able to lift herself or himself out of the pool using the side, that is not the safest way to go.

 Don’t play around in the pool.
 Be sure to show all children the proper way to exit the pool.
 Swimming under water is forbidden in the poor.
 This is to prevent children from entering the pool without your permission.
 Slipping into the water seems like the perfect way to deal with the heat.
 Something sad happens every year.
 Make sure kids know food should be eaten either before or after swimming.

Many of us have characteristics that come from our families. Maybe we have our father’s eyes or our grandmother’s hair color. But there are still other elements of our personalities such as  41   and viewpoints that we pick up by   42   our parents. Perhaps we have picked up our mother’s love of cleaning or our dad’s   43   of humor. 
	The researchers at the University of Michigan   44   there are usually three kinds of people from their   45  . 
The first kind of people are the job-oriented (以求职为目的的) people who   46   to regard a job as simply a way to make money. They   47   to working day after day and don’t think it  48   for them to do anything else. If you have a job-oriented father, you may view work this way. However, you will not   49   hold this viewpoint if you grow up close to your job-oriented mother. 
	The second are the career-oriented people who see their job as a place to gain   50  . These are the people who don’t   51  working overtime. In fact, some people love their jobs so much that they are feeling more comfortable in the   52  than at home. They are always   53  to make progress in their work. Being close to a career-oriented father means you’ll carry on your father’s.   54   enough, having a mother with this viewpoint seems to have little   55  .
	The third are the calling-oriented people who consider their job as a way to have a  56  effect on the world. They are more   57   about improving the world around them than earning    a large salary. In the study, those people came from homes where both parents had   58  . This suggests that adolescents need the   59   of both parents in order to have the confidence.
	Such as it is, we still have our   60   to find a career that suits us.

New books and old ones arrived at the British Museum a hundred years ago, and more people 
came   61   (read) them. The old reading rooms were   62   (crowd). The air was bad and readers got terrible headaches. The librarian, Panizzi, wanted poor students, as   63   as rich men, to be able to learn. He got a free copy of every new book for the British Museum. Soon, there were three rows   64   books on every shelf and hundreds of books on the floor. Something cheerful happened. Panizzi   65   (he) designed the famous round Reading Room, with a beautiful high roof and forty kilometers of   66   (bookshelf). Some of the equipment    was unusual. Cool air came up through small holes in the tables. Hot air in tubes under the floor kept readers’ feet warm. When the new Reading Room opened, there was a party with drinks  67  a large breakfast on the desks. You can imagine  68  wonderful the new Reading Room is! Since then, many famous men  69  (write) there. And the readers can enjoy all kinds of books  70  ( comfortable) in the new Reading Room.

Last week, when we learned the new word “slovenly”, we asked to make a sentence 
with it. I volunteered to do it by saying “My deskmate is a slovenly girl who clothes never 
fit her.” Hearing this, a whole class burst into laughter and my deskmate face turned red. 
After class, I learned up from the teacher that my deskmate would have dropped out of 
school if she hadn’t been helped with others. My mindless words must have hurt him deeply. 
Not until then do I realize words could be powerfully in both positive and negative ways. 
We should avoid hurt others if our words are not encouraging.

 It is March 29，2015 and the ninth Zhengkai International Marathon 2015 has been held today. I am lucky to witness the event as a volunteer for it. The race began at 8:30 a.m. and about 49.000 runners took part in it.
       In the early morning, I and other volunteers gathered at the starting point, ready to work. We carried supplies, set up tents and cleaned the streets.

       What a tiring but rewarding day! I have found happiness in the process of helping others.



齐齐哈尔市实验中学2014-2015学年度上学期期末
高三英语试题

第一部分：阅读理解（共两节，满分40分） 
    第一节 （共15小题；每小题2分，满分30分）
    阅读下列短文，从每题所给的四个选项（A、B、C、D）中，选出最佳选项。
A
My father had always been an alert observer of human character. Within seconds of meeting someone, he could sum up their strengths and weaknesses. It was always a challenge to see if any of my boyfriends could pass Dad’s test. None did. Dad was always right---they didn’t pass my test either. After Dad died, I wondered how I’d figure it out on my own.
That’s when Jack arrived on the scene. He was different from any other guy I’d dated. He could sit for hours on the piano bench with my mother, discussing some composers. My brother Rick loudly announced that Jack wasn’t a turkey like the other guys I’d brought home. Jack passed my family’s test. But what about Dad’s?
Then came my mother’s birthday. The day he was supposed to drive, I got a call. “Don’t worry,” he said, “but I’ve been in an accident. I’m fine, but I need you to pick me up.”
When I got there, we rushed to a flower shop for something for Mom. “How about gardenias?” Jack said, pointing at a beautiful white corsage(胸花). The florist put the corsage in a box.
The entire ride, Jack was unusually quiet. “Are you all right?” I asked. “I’ve been doing a lot of thinking,” he said. “I might be moving.” Moving? Then he added, “Moving in with you.” I nearly put the car on the sidewalk. “What?” I asked. “I think we should get married,” he said. He told me he’d planned his proposal in a fancy restaurant, but after the accident, he decided to do it right away. “Yes,” I whispered. We both sat dumbfounded, tears running down our cheeks. I’d never known such a tender moment. If only Dad were here to give his final approval.
“Oh, let’s just go inside.” Jack laughed. My mother opened the door. “Happy Birthday!” we shouted. Jack handed the box to her. She opened it up. Suddenly, her eyes were filled with tears. “Mom, what’s wrong?” I asked. “I’m sorry,” she said, wiping her eyes. “This is only the second gardenia corsage I’ve ever received. I was given some years ago, long before you kids were born.” “From who?” I asked. “Your father,” Mom said. “He gave me one right before we were engaged.” My eyes locked on Jack’s as I blinked away(眨掉) tears. Dad’s test? I knew Jack had passed.
1. According to the text, we know the writer’s father was __________.
   A. interested in observing things around   
   B. good at judging one’s character
   C. strict with her boyfriend             
   D. fond of challenges
2. What is the main idea of Paragraph 2?
   A. Jack knew a lot about piano.  
   B. Jack was different from any other boy.
   C. Jack was getting on well with Mother.
   D. Jack got the family’s approval except Dad’s.
3. The underlined word “proposal” in Paragraph 5 means __________.
   A. offer of marriage					   B. wedding ceremony
   C. celebration of birthday				   D. piece of advice
B
The extraordinary Eastgate Building in Harare, Zimbabwe’s capital city, is said to be the only one in the world to use the same cooling and heating principles as the termite mound(白蚁堆). 
	Architect Mick Pearce used precisely the same strategy when designing the Eastgate Building, which has no air-conditioning and almost no heating. The building—the country’s largest commercial and shopping complex—uses less than 10% of the energy of a conventional building of its size. The Eastgate’s owners saved $3.5 million on a $36 million building because an air-conditioning equipment didn’t have to be imported.
	The complex is actually two buildings linked by bridges across a shady, glass-roofed atrium(天井) open to the air. Fans suck fresh air in from the atrium, blow it upstairs through hollow spaces under the floors and from there into each office through baseboard vents(通风口). As it rises and warms, it is drawn out via ceiling vents and finally exists through forty-eight brick chimneys. 
	During summer’s cool nights, big fans blow air through the building seven times an hour to cool the empty floors. By day, smaller fans blow two changes of air an hour through the building, to circulate the air which has been in contact with the cool floors. For winter days, there are small heaters in the vents. 
	This is all possible only because Harare is 1600 feet above sea level, has cloudless skies, little dampness and rapid temperature changes—days as warm as 31℃ commonly drop to 14℃ at night. “You couldn’t do this in New York, with its hot summers and cold winters,” Pearce said. 
	The engineering firm of Ove Arup & Partners monitors daily temperatures. It is found that the temperature of the building has generally stayed between 23℃ and 25℃, with the exception of the annual hot period just before the summer rains in October and three days in November, when a doorkeeper accidentally switched off the fans at night. And the air is fresh—far more so than in air-conditioned buildings, where up to 30% of the air is recycled. 
4. Why was Eastgate cheaper to be built than a conventional building?  
   A. It was designed in a smaller size. 
   B. No air conditioners were fixed in. 
   C. Its heating system was less advanced.
   D. It used rather different building materials.
5. What does “it” refer to in Paragraph 3?
   A. Hollow space.		            B. Baseboard vent.	
   C. Fresh air from outside.			    D. Heat in the building.
6. Why would a building like Eastgate Not work efficiently in New York?
   A. New York has less clear skies as Harare.
   B. Its dampness affects the circulation of air.
   C. New York covers a larger area than Harare.
   D. Its temperature changes seasonally rather than daily.
7. The data in the last paragraph suggests Eastgate’s temperature control system_____.
   A. works better in hot seasons
   B. can recycle up to 30% of the air
   C. functions well for most of the year
   D. allows a wide range of temperatures
C
There is a popular belief among parents that schools are no longer interested in spelling. No school I have taught in has ever ignored spelling or considered it unimportant as a basic skill There are, however, vastly different ideas about how to teach it, or how much priority it must be given over in general language development and writing ability. The problem is, how to encourage a child to express himself freely and confidently in writing without holding him back with the complexities of spelling?
     If spelling becomes the only focal point of his teacher's interest, clearly a bright child will be likely to "play safe". He will tend to write only words within his spelling range, choosing to avoid adventurous language. That's why teachers often encourage the early use of dictionaries and pay attention to content rather than technical ability.
     I was once shocked to read on the bottom of a sensitive piece of writing about a personal experience: "This work is terrible! There are far too many spelling errors and your writing is illegible." It may have been a sharp criticism of the pupil's technical abilities in writing, but it was also a sad reflection on the teacher who had omitted to read the essay, which contained some beautiful expressions of the child's deep feelings. The teacher was not wrong to draw attention to the errors, but if his priorities had centered on the child's ideas, an expression of his disappointment with the presentation would have given the pupil more motivation to seek improvement. 
8. Teachers differ in their opinions about ________.
 A. the difficulties in teaching spelling 
   B. the necessity of teaching spelling  
   C. the complexities of the basic writing skills 
   D. the role of spelling in general language development 
9. The expression "play safe" probably means “_______”.
   A. to write carefully 
   B. to avoid using words one is not sure of 
   C. to do as teachers say 
    D. to use dictionaries frequently 
10. Teachers encourage the use of dictionaries so that ______.
    A. teachers will have less trouble in correcting mistakes
    B. students will have more confidence in writing
    C. students will be able to express their ideas more freely 
    D. students will learn to be independent of teachers  
11. The major point discussed in the passage is ________.
    A. the relationship between spelling and content of a composition 
    B. the importance of developing writhing skills    
    C. the correct way of marking compositions 
    D. the complexities of spelling 
D
 Cheaters called “pirates” often use camcorders(便携式摄像机) and cell phones to make illegal copies of blockbusters in the local theater. These pirates then sell those recordings on the street or over the Internet for very low prices. Some share them for free. 
“It’s unfair for people to pirate movies,” says 15-year-old Hadaia Azad Ezzulddin. Movie piracy “takes money out of the pockets of thousands of people in the movie industry,” she notes. Victims include famous actors and directors as well as local theater owners and their employees. 
Hadaia came up with an idea that could help stop movie piracy. Hadaia’s idea uses infrared(红外线的) light. This range of light is invisible to the human eye. It is visible, however, to many types of cameras. Theater owners could place small infrared lights on their movie screens. The lights would not disturb people watching the movie. It would, however, distort the recordings made by many types of cameras. 
To test her idea, Hadaia built a box with a movie screen inside. Then, she projected images on that screen through a hole in the box. She took recordings of those images, using nine different types of cameras. These included the types found in cell phones as well as camcorders. During some tests, she also turned on light emitting diodes(发光二极管), or LEDs. The LEDs were embedded（植入的）in a certain place behind the movie screen. They gave out infrared light. 
Sure enough, she showed, a pirated movie included odd stripes or spots if it had been recorded while the LEDs were on. It might be possible to use the LEDs to flash the date and time on the movie screen. The information would then appear in the illegal recordings. Theater owners or police might use the information to track down the pirates. 
Cutting down on piracy might get more people into theaters to watch the real movie instead of an illegal copy. Six out of every ten films now produced aren’t profitable. They don’t make enough money to recover how much was spent to make and market them. Such a poor payback can discourage filmmakers from producing anything but the types expected to become blockbuster hits. It might also keep smaller theaters from showing a wider variety of movie types. 
12. From what Hadaia says in Paragraph 2, we can infer that _______.
    A. most people spend less money on pirates moves
 B. the pirates don’t have to pay for the movie tickets
 C. theater owners will increase the price of movie tickets
 D. she strongly criticizes those who video movies in the theater
13. Infrared lights are put on the movie screens to _______.
    A. adjust the brightness of the movie screens
 B. make sure the images of movies are dark
 C. make illegal copies of movies unpleasant to see
 D. protect the eyesight of viewers in the darkness
14. What is the correct order of the steps in Hadaia’s test?
    a. She projected pictures on the screen.
 b. She used cameras to record the pictures. 
 c. She turned on the LEDs placed behind the screen. 
 d. She made a special box with a movie screen inside. 
     A. d c a b            B. d b a c           C. b a c d           D. b c a d
15. According to the last paragraph, we can know that _______.
    A. forty percent of movies now are profitable
 B. small theaters often choose to show low-cost movies 
 C. more and more people go to theaters to fight movie piracy
 D. filmmakers prefer to produce ordinary movies than blockbusters

根据短文内容从短文的选项中选出能填入空白处的最佳选项。选项中有两项为多余选项。
Taking a math test can be pretty stressful. Even if you know the material, you can still get the problem wrong. Knowing how to go through your math test and check your work can save you from handing in a test full of mistakes that can be avoided.   16 
Write it out
   You can also check a math problem by writing everything out on paper.   17  Writing out math problems reduces your chances of missing anything to the lowest possible level, which is a common cause of incorrect answers.
  18  
Make sure your answers work by doing the opposite procedure of what your problem calls for, including the answer you got the first time around. In other words, you would use the opposite of this addition problem—subtraction (减法)—to determine whether or not your answer is the correct one.
Plugging in
    You may find that a variable isn’t good enough or have a problem where you have to solve for a variable (变量).   19   This is the only real way to assure yourself that the answer you’ve found is correct.
Check for a reasonable answer
       20   For example, if you get an answer in the millions and you know it should be in the thousands, you’ve likely misplaced a point. Go back through the work on your paper to make sure all of your formulas and calculations are correct. If everything looks okay, do the problem again and compare the result of the second try to what you’ve got on the first try.
A. Do the opposite.
B. Correct the answers.
C. Plug the variable in the equation (方程) to check it out.
D. Therefore you’ll improve your grades, as well as your math skills.
E. It also helps you to figure out everything after you have already finished the test.
F. If the result of a problem seems to make no sense, it indicates that the answer is incorrect.
G. This helps you to know what information you have and what information you need to     solve.

What could be more refreshing than drink a can of icy cold soda after exercising? Soda is a popular drink all over the world. But drinking too many of it can have serious health consequences. For an instance, weight gain is a strongly possibility, as a result of the high sugar and calories. Drinking soda has also been linked to tooth decay(蛀牙). In fact, the acid in soda can begin damaging teeth just 20 minute after soda is drinking, according to a survey. Unfortunately, sales of soda is going down in the US, as the survey shows. That’s probably why nowadays people are more aware this sweet drink’s health risks.

                        My Views on Self-driving Travel
   Recently, as traditional Chinese festivals, such as the Tomb-sweeping Festival, the Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Day become official holidays, self-driving travel has become people’s preference in traveling.
   The reasons why more and more people choose it are as follows. On the one hand, the economic development has made it possible for more people to buy their own private cars. On the other hand, health-conscious people focus more on the quality of their life, so they will grasp every chance to enjoy their life.
    As every coin has two sides, self-driving travel is not an exception. While providing people with more chances to travel together with their family and friends, self-driving travel may also result in some problems, such as the traffic jams on the high way or even the expressway.
    Since people have to drive all the way during the tour, they have to pay special attention to the safety problem and avoid driving when exhausted.

第二部分：阅读理解（共两节，满分40分 ）
    第一节 （共15小题；每小题2分，满分30分）
    阅读下列短文，从每题所给的四个选项（A、B、C和D）中，选出最佳选项，并在答题卡上将该项涂黑。
A
When I was growing up, I had an old neighbor named Doctor Gibbs. He didn't look like any doctor I'd ever known. He never yelled at us for playing in his yard, but was always very kind.
When Doctor Gibbs wasn't saving lives, he was planting trees. He had some interesting theories about planting trees. He believed in the principle: "No pain, no gain". He hardly watered his new trees, which flew in the face of conventional wisdom. Once I asked why and he told me that watering plants spoiled them because it made them grow weaker. He said you had to make things tough for the trees so that only the strongest could survive. He talked about how watering trees made them develop shallow roots and how, if they were not watered, trees would grow deep roots in search of water. So, instead of watering his trees every morning, he'd beat them with a rolled-up newspaper. I asked him why he did that, and he said it was to get the tree's attention.
Doctor Gibbs died a couple of years after I left home. Every now and then, I walked by his house and looked at the trees that I'd watched him plant some twenty five years ago. They were all tall and strong.
I planted a couple of trees myself a few years ago. Two years of attending these trees meant they grew up weak. Whenever a cold wind blew, their branches trembled. Adversity(逆境) seemed to benefit Doctor Gibb's trees in ways comfort and ease never could.
Every night before I go to bed, I check on my two sons. I often pray that their lives will be easy. But lately I've been thinking that it's time to change my prayer. I know my children are going to meet with hardship. There's always a cold wind blowing somewhere. What we need to do is to pray for deep roots, so when the rains fall and the winds blow, we won't be torn apart. 
21. With the trees planted, Doctor Gibbs often __________.
A. kept watering them every morning	
B. paid little attention to them	
C. talked to them to get their attention
   D. beat them to make them grow deep roots
22. What does the author think of the way Doctor Gibbs planted trees?
   A. strange and harmful				
B. interesting and funny
   C. original and reasonable			
D. cruel and unacceptable
23. Which prayer does the author wish for his sons?
   A. Have an easy life, without too much to worry about.
   B. Meet people like Dr Gibbs in the future.
   C. Have good luck, encountering less hardship in their life.
   D. Be able to stand the rain and wind in their lives.
24. Which of the following can be the best title of the passage?
A. Prayers for my sons			
B. Doctor Gibbs and his trees
C. Growing roots		       	
D. Watering trees

The world’s first completely paperless public library is located in Bexar County, Texas, in the United States.
    Bexar County’s so-called Biblio Tech is a low-cost project with big ambitions. Its first branch is in a relatively poor district on the south side of the city of San Antonio. It has 100 e-readers on loan, and dozens of screens where the public are able to browse (浏览), study, and learn digital skills.
    It is a truly bookless library — although that is not a phrase much to the liking of BiblioTech’s project co-ordinator, Laura Cole. She prefers the description “digital library”— after all, there are books there, but in digital form.
    Christopher Platt, director of collections and circulation at the New York Public Library, argued that accessing a digital version of a book was not enough. “People travel from all over the world to our library, not just to access an item, but to touch it and feel it in order to get a sense of the overall importance of the work,” he said.
    But “bookless” does not mean “cheap”. Publishers charge libraries up to five times the normal hardback (精装本) price for an e-book of a popular title, Christopher Platt said. And certain types of e-books simply do not work as well as printed books, especially when some library e-readers are still text-only. This was just one of many reasons, he felt, that bookless libraries would not be sweeping the board just yet.
    Children’s author Alan Gibbons is a firm believer in the role of libraries, especially school libraries. Working in international schools in China and Thailand, Mr. Gibbons noted that even in the best schools where every child was given an iPad, the school library, stocked with real books, was seen as an important resource.
    Christopher Platt at the New York Public Library has another view on the bookless future: “It’s still early. We’ve spent 100 years getting the print stuff right, so it could be a while before we get the e-stuff right.”
28. What can we learn about the paperless public library in Texas?
A. It was built in a rich district.
B. People can develop digital skills there.
C. It cost a large sum of money.        
D. It’s the world’s biggest library.
29. By saying “bookless does not mean cheap”, Christopher Platt means that _________.
A. travelling to the library costs foreign readers a lot
B. e-readers are very expensive
C. readers must pay to read in the digital library
D. e-books are more expensive than printed ones
30. The underlined phrase “sweeping the board” in Paragraph 5 probably means _____.
A. fading out               		B. leaving quickly
C. becoming successful        		D. coming soon
31. Which of the following might Alan Gibbons agree with?
A. School libraries with printed books won’t disappear.
B. Asian children like printed books.
C. Asian children like electronic products.
D. Printed books in school libraries need improving.
D
You get anxious if there’s no wi-fi in the hotel or mobile phone signal up the mountain. You feel upset if your phone is getting low on power, and you secretly worry things will go wrong at work if you’re not there. All these can be called “always on” stress caused by smartphone addiction.
    For some people, smartphones have liberated them from the nine-to-five work. Flexible working has given them more autonomy(自主权) in their working lives and enabled them to spend more time with their friends and families. For many others though, smartphones have become tyrants (暴君) in their pockets, never allowing them to turn them off, relax and recharge their batteries.
    Pittsburgh-based developer Kevin Holesh was worried about how much he was ignoring his family and friends in favour of his iPhone. So he developed an app — Moment — to monitor his usage. The app enables users to see how much time they’re spending on the device and set up warnings if the usage limits are breached (突破). “Moment’s goal is to promote balance in your life,” his website explains. “Some time on your phone, some time off it enjoying your loving family and friends around you.”
   Dr Christine Grant, an occupational psychologist at Coventry University, said, “The effects of this ‘always on’ culture are that your mind is never resting, and you’re not giving your body time to recover, so you’re always stressed. And the more tired and stressed we get, the more mistakes we make. Physical and mental health can suffer.”
    And as the number of connected smartphones is increasing, so is the amount of data. This is leading to a sort of decision paralysis (瘫痪) and is creating more stress in the workplace because people have to receive a broader range of data and communications which are often difficult to manage. “It actually makes it more difficult to make decisions and many do less because they’re controlled by it all and feel they can never escape the office,” said Dr Christine Grant.
32. What’s the first paragraph mainly about? 
A. The popularity of smartphones.
B. The progress of modern technology.
C. The signs of “always on” stress.
D. The cause of smartphone addiction.
33. Kevin Holesh developed Moment to __________.
A. research how people use their mobile phones
B. help people control their use of mobile phones
C. make people better use mobile phones
D. increase the fun of using mobile phones
34. What’s Dr Christine Grant’s attitude towards “always on” culture?
A. Confused.        B. Positive.       C. Doubtful.       D. Critical.
35. According to the last paragraph, a greater amount of data means __________.
A. we will become less productive
B. we can make a decision more quickly
C. we will be equipped with more knowledge
D. we can work more effectively

Travel tips that are no longer true
We all love an inside trip, but some of the classic tips for travelers no longer hold true. ___36___ 
1. Book a plane ticket far in advance to save money.
This myth may have been true back in the 1960s, when flights were less common than they are today. Back then, the demand for a flight would naturally increase as the date approached, there being few other options.    37    According to recent studies, the best time to buy a domestic ticket was between six and seven weeks before.
2.    38    
Don’t ignore the benefits of going straight to the hotel to negotiate (商谈) a good deal on a room. Many hotel chains offer rate guarantees and encourage customers to book directly. Hotels also frequently have discounts or some offers that third-party websites don’t know. Apart from this, hotels give the upgrades, not the booking agents. 
3. Avoid street food.
   39    If this means standing up at a cheap street stall (摊位), then follow the crowd. Don’t sit down at a restaurant and spend four times more, on the simple assumption that it’s the only safe option. Can you see what’s going on in the kitchen?
4. Carry your money in a special pocket or pouch.
This is the fastest way to stand out from locals — who will have their money in a wallet or purse. Only take what you need when you leave your hotel room.    40   
A. When in Rome, do what the Romans do.
B. And make sure to put your wallet in a front pocket.
C. This is only true if you are buying products that are heavily taxed.
D. Let yourself relax in a warm room for one or two people in single beds.
E. Check the updates on these tall tales (说大话) to save cash and add experience to your trip.
F. These days, many alternatives for the most popular routes mean that demand stays steady.
G. The best hotel prices are on travel websites.

Maureen worked in an office with twenty other people, and she liked her job. Getting ahead in her career wasn’t   41   to her until the day that her friend and co-worker Betty was promoted to be the boss of the unit. Betty couldn’t have gotten the     42   if Maureen had tried to. In the eyes of the other co-workers Betty was always cheerful,   43   and ambitious, while Maureen was low-key (低调的) and easy-going.
Before Betty got the promotion, Maureen had been   44   at her work, even if she had not been specially happy. But once Betty was made   45  , Maureen began to fill up with resentment (怨恨) until she   46   her job and hated Betty.   47   she made a big mistake because she had a feeling of   48   all the time.

Maureen became completely   52   on her resentment, and she couldn’t get out of the   53   situation.
One of the major problems with resentment is that you believe that your   54   is entirely caused by some outside person. You stop   55   what you can do to improve your situation, because you decide that your injured feelings are the   56   of someone else’s fault. You just give up trying to find real   57  . Dealing with resentment needs awareness and   58  . First of all, you need to   59   you are feeling resentful and then try to stop yourself feeling upset.

The Unexpected Kindness Of A Stranger
Yesterday, as I approached the front door of our public library, a white-haired gentleman stepped back to hold the door for me. You see, I have to go everywhere these days with a walker, and folks are 61. __________ (constant) holding or opening doors for me, so this was not unusual.

    "Cleverness is a gift while kindness is a choice． Gifts are easy - they're given after all. Choices can, be hard " －Jeff Bezos
    I got the idea to start Amazon 16 years ago． I came across the fact that the Internet usage was growing at 2,300 percent per year． I'd never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast, and the idea of building 'an online bookstore with millions of titles was very exciting to me．  I had just turned 30 years old, and I'd been married for a year． I told my wife MacKenzie that I wanted to quit my job and go to do this crazy thing that probably wouldn’t work since most start-ups don't, and I wasn’t sure what to expect． MacKenzie told me I should go for it． As a young boy, I'd been a garage inventor．  I'd always wanted to be an: inventor, and she wanted me to follow my passion．
    I was working at a financial firm in New York City with a bunch of very smart people, and I had a brilliant boss that I much admired． I went to my boss and told him I wanted to start a company selling books on the Internet． He took me on a long walk in Central Park, listened carefully to me, and finally said, "That sounds like a really good idea, but it would be
an even better idea for someone who didn't already have a good job”）That logic made some sense to me, and he convinced me to think about it for 48 hours before making a final decision． Seen in that light, it really was a difficult choice, but finally, I decided I had to give it a shot． I didn't think I'd regret trying and failing． And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all．
    After much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice． For all of us, in the end, we are our choices．
21．What inspired the author with the idea of building an online bookstore?
   A．His dream of being an inventor．
   B．The support of his wife．
   C．The greatly increasing usage of the Internet．
   D．Millions of exciting titles．
22．Which of the following is closest in meaning to the underlined sentence?．
   A．The idea of not trying would keep coming to his mind and disturb him．
	B．He would be very excited if he tried it out．
	C．He would be always having a doubt if he didn't try．
	D．The decision to not try the online bookstore would terrify him．
23．We can know from the passage that          ．
   A．the boss thought the idea was suitable for the author
   B．the author wanted someone else to try the idea
   C．the author might not regret if he failed the idea
   D．the author might go back to his boss if he failed
24．Which of the following would be the best title for the passage? ．
   A．Cleverness and Kindness    	B．The Starting of Amazon 
  	C．Following My Passion   	D．We Are What We Choose  
B
    In Britain and other countries, young people sometimes take a "gap year," a year off between high school and college, This idea never gained a big following in America  Recent news reports have suggested that interest may be growing, though there are no official numbers．
     Charles Deacon, Dean of Admissions at Georgetown University in Washington, D．C．estimates that in the current first-year class of 1600 students, only about 25 decided to take a year off． He says this number has not changed much over the years． 
     Mr．Deacon says the most common reason for taking a "gap year" is to have a chance to travel, but he says international students may take a "gap year" to meet requirements at home for military duty．
     Some high school graduates see a year off as a chance to recover after twelve years of required education, but it can also give students a chance to explore their interests．Students hoping to be doctors, for example, could learn about the profession by volunteering in a hospital．
     Many colleges and universities support gap-year projects by permitting students to delay their admission． Experts say students can grow emotionally and intellectually as they work at something they enjoy．
    The Harvard admissions office has an essay on its website called "Time Out or Burn Out for the Next Generation．"  It praises the idea of taking time off． to step back, think and enjoy gaining life experiences outside the pressure of studies． It also notes that students are sometimes admitted to Harvard or other colleges partly because they did something unusual with that time．
    Of course, a "gap year" is not for everyone, Students might miss their friends who go on directly to college． And parents might worry that their children will decide not to go to college once they take time off． Another concern is money． A year off, away from home, can be costly．
    Holly Bull's job is to specialize in helping students plan their "gap year¨． She notes that several books have been written about this subject． She says these books along with media attention and the availability of information on the Internet have increased interest in the idea of a year off, and she points out that many gap-year programs cost far less than a year of college．
25．What is the passage mainly about?
    A．More and more American students are choosing to take a year off．  :
    B．If you want to go to an American university, take a "gap year" first．
    C．It is likely that taking a "gap year" is becoming popular in America          -

   B．some famous universities encourage students to gain more life experiences
   C．taking a "gap year" can make students free from life learning
   D．the stress of studies does harm to the students' health
28．What can we learn from the passage?
   	A．Books and media have contributed to the students' interest in school learning．
   	B．Charles Deacon doesn't support the idea of the students' taking a "gap year"．
  	C．Parents night disagree with the program, concerned about their children's future．

     In our world today, the media and entertainment industries are constantly focusing on beauty over brains． Movies, television shows, commercials, and magazines all utilize （使用） models and actors whose physical attributes（特性） will sell their product．
     As our country becomes so obsessed with trying to reduce the obesity numbers, eating disorder statistics continue to increase due to the push for thinner people． While obesity is a serious medical condition that can lead to many health problems, many of us try to lose weight for appearance purposes． Children as young as elementary school age have begun to worry about the numbers that appear on the scale, In my opinion, it seems that fat" has become the new ;;ugly"．
     Two weeks ago, 37-year-old Wisconsin television reporter Livingston, who is 235 pounds, received an email from a man named Krause． In the email Krause attacked her, writing, "Your physical condition hasn't improved for many years． Surely you don't consider yourself a 'suitable example for this community's young people, girls in particular．"
     Today, it seems that a vast majority of people care more about how they look and appear
                                                                                      to their peers rather than what is inside． The truth is that every person is built differently; we all come in different shapes and sizes．  Someone is heavier, which doesn't mean they eat large amounts of junk food and lounge around all day． Likewise, even though a person is thin, it doesn't mean they are necessarily healthy and fit．
    If you are reading this and you struggle with your weight or your appearance, please recognize that you are beautiful and special in your own way． You are worth h so much more than you realize, and even if I don't know you, understand that I respect and support you．Beauty is not defined by size; it is defined by how we treat others and respect ourselves． In the words of the talented film actress Kirstie Alley, "There's a lot more to life than how fat or thin you are．"
29．According to the author, why do elementary school children worry about the numbers that appear on the scale?
    A．They want to appear in ads to sell their product．
    B．They are concerned about their health．
    C．They are suffering from eating disorder．
    D．They want to look slim．
30．The writer used the example of Jennifer Livingston to show        ．
    A．people think "fat" looks ugly
    B．fat people should lose weight
    C．physical condition needs improving     
    D．young girls won't follow fat models
31．What Kirstie Alley said means _       ．
    A．people should pay attention to the appearance
    B．there is no need for any people to go on diet
    C．people are beautiful when they concern others
    D．there's always someone who understands and supports you

    Rats that eat high levels of a natural sugar known as fructose（果糖）seem to age faster than other rats-and the same could be true for people who eat too much sweet junk food, Israeli researchers said Monday．
     Fructose, found naturally in honey and fruit, is used widely in foods ranging from soft drinks to yogurt．But while its sweet taste is popular, the sugar could cause wrinkles, the researchers said． Dr．Moshe Werman and Boaz Levi of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology fed large amounts of fructose to laboratory rats． Writing in the Journal of Nutrition, they said the fructose-fed rats showed changes in the collagen （胶原蛋白） of their skin and bones． Collagen basically holds the body together． The loss of collagen is what causes loose skin and deep wrinkles in older people,
       The process affected, Werman's team said, is known as cross-linking（交叉相连） "．"Too much cross-linking makes the skin stiff, and these are the conditions that encourage wrinkled skin," Werman said in a statement． He said the same could be true of people, although this has not been shown． "Americans are eating more and more processed foods such as baked goods, canned fruits, jams and dairy products that contain fructose," Werman said．Other studies have shown that taking in high fructose may cause diabetes（糖尿病）．
     The rats Werman worked with were fed much more than the average adult person might eat in a day, which is standard in such experiments． The rats were fed  12.5 grams of fructose per’kg of weight every day for a year．

32．In 'the experiments, if a rat was 0．25 kg, it ma>' have been fed about      grams of fructose every day for a year．
  	A．3    	B．4         	C． 5         	D．6
33．Why do older people have deep wrinkles according to the passage?
   	A．They don't drink enough water every day．'
   B．They don't take enough exercise every day．
   C．Collagen in their body is lost,
   D．Their daily foods do not contain enough fructose．
34．What can we learn from the passage?
   A．The fructose-fed rats only showed changes in the collagen of their sk¨n．
   B．Too much cross-linking makes the skin soft．
   C．The amount of sugar the rats ate was larger than an ordinary adult might eat in a day．
   D．It hasn't been shown that taking in high fructose may cause diabetes．
35．The best title for the passage should be “       ” ．
   	A．Sugar-it could reduce collagen
   	B．Collagen-it could age you
  	C．Collagen-it could cause wrinkles
  	D．Sugar-it could age you

第二部分 阅读理解（共两节，共50分）
    第一节 阅读下列短文，从每题所给的四个选项（A、B、C、D）中，选出最佳选项，并在答题卡上将该项涂黑。（共20小题；每小题2分，共40分）
A
The meaning of the word “volunteer ” may be a little different in different countries, but it usually means “one who offers his or her services.” There are many different ways in which people can volunteer, such as taking care of sick people, working in homes for homeless children, and picking up garbage(垃圾) from beaches and parks. Volunteers may work within their own countries or in other countries. They are often people with a strong wish to help those who are less fortunate than themselves. Volunteers don’t expect any kind of pay.
   At the root of volunteering is the idea that one person may have the ability to offer services that can help other people. Tracy, a good friend of mine, however, recently came back from India with a new idea of what being a volunteer means. She worked for two and a half weeks in one of Mother Teresa’s homes in Calcutta. The following is her story.
   “I first heard about Mother Teresa in my high school. We watched a video(录像) about her work in India and all over the world. I was so moved by her spirit to help others and her endless love for every human being that after I graduated from high school, I, too, wanted to try her kind of work. So with two friends I flew to Calcutta for a few weeks.”
   “I was asked to work in a home for sick people. I helped wash clothes and sheets, and pass out lunch. I also fed the people who were too weak to feed themselves and tried to cheer them up. I felt it was better to share with them than to think that I had helped them. To be honest, I don’t think I was helping very much. It was then that I realized that I had not really come to help, but to learn about and experience another culture(文化) that helped improve my own understanding of life and the world.”
31. According to the text, a volunteer refers to a person who ______.
   A. is willing to help those in need without pay
   B. can afford to travel to different places
   C. has a strong wish to be successful
   D. has made a big fortune in life
32. Tracy started her work as a volunteer _______.
   A. after she met Mother Teresa
   B. after she finished high school
   C. when she was touring Calcutta
   D. when she was working in a hospital
33. Why did Tracy choose to be a volunteer?
   A. She liked to work with Mother Teresa.
   B. She had already had some experience.
   C. She was asked by Mother Teresa’s example.
   D. She wanted to follow Mother Teresa’s example.
34. What is Tracy’s “new idea” (Paragraph 2) of being a volunteer?
   A. Going abroad to help the sick.
   B. Working in Mother Teresa’s home.
   C. Doing simple things to help the poor. 
   D. Improving oneself through helping others.
                                      B
   Two years ago we were at a turning point in our lives in New Zealand, so we decided to start an adventure. We gave up our jobs, said goodbye to friends and family, and went to live in Switzerland.
   Settling in the small town of Aadorf, we sent our daughters, who were 15 and 11 at the time, to the local school. They were the only English speakers in the school, and as they had no German or local Swiss dialect (方言), we knew their path would be hard. But after only a few months, the girls were doing really well, and making every effort to integrate (融合) into the Swiss way of life. As a result, the local newspaper ran a story about them.
   When the half-page article, complete with a photo, appeared in the newspaper, the girls were delighted. But what followed next still had us shaking our heads in astonishment.
   A teacher from the school showed the article to a friend, who sent the article to friends of his, a Swiss family who happened to be nearing the end of their 12-month stay in New Zealand. When they read how we missed feijoas—a fruit unknown in Switzerland—they looked out of the window at the huge feijoa tree weighed down with fruit. So they picked two kilograms of feijoas and brought them back with them to Switzerland—especially for us. They gave the fruit to their friend, who then drove two hours to secretly deliver the precious load to us.
   When we opened the front door later that day, a big bag of feijoas was sitting there. We had no idea how it got there. A note left inside the bag helped us start to uncover the mystery (谜). It was from the family, wishing us all the best and happy eating.
35. Why did the local newspaper carry a story about the girls?
   A. Because they had an exciting adventure.
   B. Because they tried hard to join in the local life.
   C. Because they became fluent speakers of local Swiss dialect.
   D. Because they were the only English speakers in the school.
36. What made the family shake their heads in astonishment?
   A. That the article was quickly passed on.
   B. That the article made the girls delighted.
   C. The expensive fruit secretly delivered to them.
   D. The hometown fruit unexpectedly found at their door.
37. It turned out that the bag of feijoas came from ________.
A. the author's friend				
B. the teacher's friend
C. the teacher from the local school 	
D. the Swiss family back from New Zealand
38. Which of the following would be the best title?

Monarch Butterflies
    One of the last West Coast homes of the Monarch butterfly, a type of insect（昆虫）, may soon disappear. Strangely, it is in a town that calls itself Butterfly USA, Pacific Grove, California.
   The town of Pacific Grove loves the butterflies. Every year they have a parade（游行）and hundreds of children dress up as butterflies. Monarch butterflies are the town mascot. Tourism is very important, and many people come to see the butterflies. The butterflies are good for the development of the town.
In 1981 there were so many butterflies it looked like it was raining butterflies. Tens of thousands of Monarchs stayed on tree branches near Pacific Grove. Now there are not so many. The building goes on a little bit at a time, and you don’t notice it day by day. Over time, you can see that there has been a lot of development. As new buildings go up, many trees are cut down. This reduces the natural homes for the butterflies.
Monarchs travel hundreds of miles each year，returning to the same woods, often to the same trees. The female Monarchs need milkweed to lay their eggs; the males will follow the females. Millions of Monarchs have traveled regularly along the same path for thousands of years. They start their trip in the mountains of Mexico and travel to the middle part of America. If the woods where the butterflies live are destroyed, the whole species（物种）could be lost. There have been Monarch butterflies along the coast of California for as long as man can remember, but no one is sure how much longer they will last.
43. Why are Monarch butterflies important to Pacific Grove?
A. They may disappear.             	
B. They come to stay every year.
C. They help develop the town’s tourism.	
D. They give a name to Pacific Grove.
44. The underlined word “mascot” in Paragraph 2 probably refers to_________.
A. a new type of butterfly            	
B. an insect believed to bring good luck
C. a parade organized by Pacific Grove  	
D. a special dress for children in Pacific Grove
45. What problem do Monarch butterflies face now?
   A. New buildings take up their living space.
   B. There has been too much rain in recent years.
   C. Their natural homes are destroyed by tourism.
   D. They have to travel a long distance to get home.
46. Where do Monarch butterflies start their trip to Pacific Grove?
A. From Central America.     			
B. From the West Coast.
C. From California.          			
D. From Mexico.

Sorry to say, our brains naturally start slowing down at the cruelly young age of 30. It used to be thought that this couldn't be helped, but new studies show that people of any age can train their brains to work faster. "Your brain is a learning machine," says University of California scientist Dr. Michael Merzenich. Given the right tools, we can train our brains to act like they did when we were younger. All that's required is the practice designed just for the purpose a few exercises for the mind.
Merzenich has developed a computer-based training method to speed up the process(过程)                         in which the brain deals with information (positscience.com). Since much of the data we receive comes through speech, the Brain Fitness Program works with language and hearing to better speed and accuracy (准确性).
Over the course of training, the program starts asking you to distinguish (辨别) sounds (between "dog" and "bog", for example) at an increasingly faster speed. It's a bit like tennis instructor, says Merzenich, hitting balls at you—faster and faster to keep you challenged(受到挑战). You may start out slow, but before long you're pretty quick.
The biggest finding in brain research in the last ten years is that the brain at any age is highly plastic. If you ask your brain to learn, it will learn. And it may even speed up while in the process.
To keep your brain young and plastic you can do one of a million new activities that challenge and excite you playing table tennis or bridge, doing crossword puzzles, learning a language.... "When it comes to preventing ageing, you really do 'use it or lose it' ," says Barbara Sahakian, professor at Cambridge University.
47. Dr. Merzenich’s training method mainly depends on ________. 
A. speech training    				
B. computer languages
C. the activities one joins in     		
D. the information being dealt with
48. By saying "the brain at any age is highly plastic", the writer probably means the brain can be____. 
A. used     		
B. mastered    	
C. developed     		
D. researched
49. What can we learn from the text?
   A. Practice makes a quick mind.
   B. Brain research started ten yeas ago.
   C. Dr. Merzenich is a scientist in computer.
   D. People believed nothing could stop the brain slowing down.
50. Which of the following agrees with the writer's idea?
   A. The training methods work better for the old.
   B. People should use the brain to stop it from ageing.
   C. The training of the brain should start at an early age.
   D. It's necessary to take part in as many activities as possible.

    阅读下面短文，并按照题目要求用英语问答问题（请注意问题后词数要求）。
When I was a boy growing up in New Jersey in the 1960s, we had a milkman delivering milk to our doorstep. His name was Mr. Basille. He wore a white cap and drove a white truck. As a 5-year-old boy, I couldn’t take my eyes off the coin changer(自动换币器) fixed to his belt. He noticed this one day during a delivery and gave me a quarter out of his coin changer.
Of course, he delivered more than milk. There was cheese, eggs and so on. If we needed to change our order, my mother would pen a note---“Please add a bottle of buttermilk next delivery”---and place it in the box along with the empty bottles. And then, the buttermilk would magically appear.
All of this was about more than convenience. There existed a close relationship between families and their milkmen. Mr. Basille even had a key to our house, for those times when it was so cold outside that we put the box indoors, so that the milk wouldn’t freeze. And I remember Mr. Basille from time to time taking a break at our kitchen table, having a cup of tea and telling stories about his delivery. Mr Basille always said “delivering milk is hard if you want to do it well but I love my job.”
There is sadly no home milk delivery today. Big companies allowed the production of cheaper milk, thus making it difficult for milkmen to compete. Besides, milk is for sale everywhere, and it may just not have been practical to have a delivery service.
Recently, an old milk box in the countryside I saw brought back my childhood memories. I took it home and planted it on the back porch(门廊). Often my son’s friends will ask what it is. So I start telling stories of my boyhood, and of the milkman who brought us friendship along with his milk.

作文
As we grow up, we are bound to meet with difficulties in our study. A difficulty I encountered was that I had strong Chinese accent while communicating with others in English, making everyone laugh at me. Confronted with the difficulty, I bought lots of CDs of native speakers' public speaking, and tried to imitate their intonation every day. Besides, I often turned to the teacher for help, who always helped correct my pronunciation. As a result, I made great progress.

A
There was once a king who had a wise advisor. The advisor followed the king everywhere and his favorite piece of advice to the king was “Everything happens for the good.”
One day the king went hunting (狩猎) and had a small accident. His foot was injured. Fortunately he was not badly injured but as always he was forced to ask his advisor what he thought about the accident, to which the advisor replied, “Everything happens for the good.”
This time the king was really angry and put his advisor in prison (监狱). The king then asked his advisor, “Now, what do you think?” The advisor again answered, “Everything happens for the good.”
About a week later the king went on another hunting trip. As it turned out the king was caught by some cannibals (食人者) and taken to their camp where he would be prepared to be their evening meal. Before putting him into the cooking pot, he was examined and the cannibals realized that the king’s foot was injured. They decided to throw him back into the forests. It is the tradition for the cannibals not to eat anything that was in any way injured.
It is true that everything in our lives happens for a purpose, and most often for our own good. If you think about it, all our past experiences actually happened to bring us to where we are today and make us a better person. So whatever challenges that we may face today, consider it happening to bring us to the next level.

24. By telling the story, the writer        .
     A. tells us the danger of hunting                 B. asks us not to hunt any more

  I had saved some money . After hearing about her troubles, I went downstairs and put a note of $50 in the front pocket of the handbag in secret. I didn’t want to give her money directly, because I knew it would embarrass her and that she would refuse it since I’m a kid and don’t have a job.
  However, I’m very happy with what I did. Although I do not know whether she can find who has given her the money, I know it is of use to her. She is raising a family and has large medical needs! I hope more people know how bad my aunt’s situation really is so that she get more help.

In the past two decades, the Chinese economy has undergone many reforms in an effort to compete more effectively on the international market. These reforms included allowing foreign banks to offer credit cards to Chinese citizens. Now, researchers at the University of Missouri(MU) have found about 30% of Chinese urban households now own at least one credit card and the growth rate of credit adoption has been an average of 40% per year between 2004 and 2009.
   Rui Yao, an assistant professor of personal financial planning at MU, says that this large growth in such a small amount of time has positive and negative implications for the Chinese economy.
   “With more and more people taking advantage of credit cards in China, it certainly increases potential consumer buying power,” Yao said. “However, we found that more than 90% of credit card users were unaware of safety issues existing in credit card use and more than 60% had little knowledge of the consequences of credit card debt. This lack of knowledge could create problems as credit card ownership is expected to grow at a rate of 11% a year.”
   Yao found that while 72% of Chinese credit card holders were never late on their payment, only 55% were able to pay the full balance. She also found that 70% of Chinese credit card holders said that credit cards contributed to overspending.

Mosquitoes have an extraordinary ability to target humans far away and fly straight to their unprotected skin.
  _____(36)_____.Some mosquitoes spread several serious diseases, including Dengue, yellow fever and malaria. Over one million people worldwide die from these mosquito-borne diseases each year.
  New research now shows how mosquitoes choose who to bite. _____(37)_____.They are attracted to human skin and breath. They smell the carbon dioxide gas -- which all mammals breathe out. This gas is how mosquitoes know that a warm-blooded creature is nearby.____(38)_____.
Michael Dickinson is a professor at the California Institute of Technology. His research shows how these small insects, with even smaller brains, use three senses to find a blood meal. "We suspected from research that we had been doing on fruit flies that vision might play a very large and underappreciated role in allowing the mosquito to really home in on the potential host target."
   Michael Dickinson's team used plumes - material that rises into the air -- of carbon dioxide gas into a wind tunnel（隧道）. ______(39)_____.The insects followed the plume. Then, the scientists placed dark objects on the lighter colored floor and walls of the tunnel.
   Mr. Dickinson said, at first, the mosquitoes showed no interest in the objects at all." What was quite striking and quite surprising is that the mosquitoes fly back and forth for hours--these are hungry females--and they completely ignore the objects on the floor and wall of the tunnel. But the moment that they get a hit of CO2, they change their behavior quite dramatically and now would become attracted to these little visual blobs（斑点）."_____(40)_____.
A. But mosquitoes also use their eyes and sense of touch.
B. Once mosquitoes catch a smell of a human or animal, they also follow visual cues.
C. Regrettably, mosquitoes can do more than cause an itchy wound
D. They then used cameras to record the mosquitoes.
E. Mosquitoes need blood to survive.
F. The study, published in Current Biology, details the steps of the mosquito's flight so that we may one day have a fighting chance against the biting insect.
G. This suggested to the researchers that a mosquito's sense of smell is more important in the search for food.

Recently some Chinese educational experts did a survey among more than 1000 students from Beijing and Guangzhou on their favorite festivals. The result shows that about half of the respondents choose the Spring Festival as their most favorite. Next comes Christmas Day and Mothers’ or Fathers’ Day, with 20% and 10% respectively. However, Mid-Autumn Day accounts for less than 10%. From the survey, we can see although over 80% of the students are familiar with our traditional festivals, like the Spring Festival, more and more young people favor some foreign festivals.

    A tender woman, or an independent one, which one would you prefer? Arecent research shows that most people would choose the latter.
    This type of woman is called a nühanzi (“tough woman”). Experts believethese characteristics have social and psychological roots among young femalesin China. Su Hao’s friends all call her a tough woman, because she can finishtough tasks usually carried out by men. For example, she carries 10-litre waterto her dormitory on the 5th floor. “I depend on no one but myself,” she says.
    According to a recent survey by China Youth Daily, tough women havebecome rather common in society. Of the 21,265 respondents, 78.5 percent saidthey are familiar with a tough woman. About 50 percent said they like womenwith tough characteristics, while less than 29 percent expressed the oppositeview.
    Why are tough women gaining popularity? Shen Meng, a psychologicalconsultant, believes the fierce competition in society is contributing to thistrend. “Women are often in a disadvantaged position compared to men,” Shensays. “In order to survive, they have to be independent, strong and tough.” Liu
Xiaolin, professor of psychology at Wuhan Mental Health Center, believestough women are brought up this way. They are often on close relationship withtheir fathers, who teach their daughters to be brave and decisive,” he says. As aresult, these women are more likely to be psychologically healthy and moretolerant to stress, according to Liu.
    Though Liu believes that this is a good trend, Hu Shenzhi, a psychologistat the Guangdong Sunflower Counseling Center, says the popularity of toughwoman indicates an unclear line between gender identities, which can lead torelationship problems. “Some women with characteristics that differ from thetraditional female image may have a difficult time finding Mr Right,” he says.“Even if they get married, their manly characteristics might cause familyconflicts.

24. Which of the followings does NOT belong to the characteristics of a tough
    woman?

    A. She is soft and tender to others.
    B. She is independent of others in daily life.
    C. She is more tolerant to stress.
    D. She can solve problems usually for men.

25. How many respondents like tough women?
    A. about 16,700.                  B. 21,265.
    C. about 6,200                    D. about 10,600.

26. Why are there more tough women nowadays?

    A. Because tough women are more lovely.
    B. Because of the fierce competition in society.
    C. Because more women want to be independent.
    D. Because girls often love fathers more.

27. What problems may tough women have in their life?

    A. It’s difficult for them to be friends.
    B. They often suffer gender confusion.
    C. They may have difficulty with marriage.
    D. They have different characteristics form traditional female images.

C

    We are all interested in equality, but while some people try to protect theschool and examination system in the name of equality, others, still in the nameof equality, want only to destroy it．
   Any society which is interested in equality of opportunity and standards ofachievement must regularly test its pupils．The standards may be changed—noexamination is perfect—but to have tests or examinations would mean the endof equality and of standards．There are groups of people who oppose this viewand who do not believe either in examinations or in any controls in school or onteachers．This would mean that everything would depend on luck since everypupil would depend on the efficiency, the values and the purpose of eachteacher．
   Without examinations, employers will look for employees from the highlyrespected schools and from families known to them －a form of favoritismwill replace equality．At the moment, the bright child from an ill-respectedschool can show certificates to prove he or she is suitable for a job, while thelack of certificate indicates the unsuitability of a dull child attending awell-respected school．This defending of excellence and opportunity woulddisappear if examinations were taken away, and the bright child from a poorfamily would be a prisoner of his or her school’s reputation(声誉), unable tocompete for employment with the child from the favored school．
  The opponents of the examination system suggest that examinations are anevil force because they show differences between pupils．According to thesepeople, there must be no special, different, academic class．They have evensuggested that there should be no form of difference in sport or any other area:all jobs or posts should be filled by unsystematic selection．The selection wouldbe made by people who themselves are probably selected by some computers．28．The word “favoritism” is used to describe the phenomenon that _____．

    A．children from well-respected schools tend to have good jobs
    B．bright children also need certificates go get satisfying jobs．
    C．poor children with certificates are favored in job markets
    D．children attending ordinary schools achieve great success

29．What would happen if exams were taken away according to the author?

    A．Schools for bright children would lose their reputation．
    B．There would be more opportunities and excellence．
    C．Children’s job opportunity  would be  affected  by  their  school  reputation．
D．Children from poor families would be able to change their schools．
30．The opponents of the examination system will agree that _____．

    A．computers should be selected to take over many jobs
    B．jobs should not be assigned（分配） by systematic selection
    C．special classes are necessary to keep the school standards
    D．schools with academic subjects should be done away with

31．The passage mainly focuses on _____．
    A．examination and equality        B.  schools and certificates
    C．opportunity and employment       D． standards and reputation


D

    As you are probably aware，the latest job markets news isn’t good：Unemployment is still more than 9 percent，and new job growth has fallen closeto zero．That’s bad for the economy，of course．And it may be especiallydiscouraging if you happen to be looking for a job or hoping to change careersright now．But it actually shouldn’t matter to you nearly as much as you think．That’s because job growth numbers don’t matter to job hunters as much as jobstaff-turnover(人员流动)data．After all，existing jobs open up every day due topromotions，resignations(辞职)，and retirements．(Yes，people are retiring evenin this economy．)In both good times and bad，staff-turnover creates moreopenings than economic growth does．Even in June of 2014，when the economywas still booming along，job growth was only 132，000，while staff-turnoverwas 4.7 million!

   And as it turns out，even today—with job growth near zero—over 4 millionjob hunters are being hired every month．

   I don’t mean to imply that overall job growth doesn’t have an impact onone’s ability to land a job．It’s true that if total employment were higher．itwould mean more jobs for all of us to choose from(and compete for)．And it'strue that there are currently more people applying for each available  jobopening，regardless of whether it’s a new one or not．

   But what often distinguishes those who land jobs from those who don’t istheir ability to stay motivated．They’re willing to do the hard work ofidentifying their valuable skills；be creative about where and how to look；learnhow to present themselves to potential employers；and keep going，even afterrepeated rejections．The Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that 2.7 millionpeople who wanted and were available for work hadn’t hunted for it within thelast four weeks and were no longer even classified as unemployed．

   So don’t let the headlines fool you into giving up．Four million people gethired every month in the U.S.．You can be one of them.

32．The author tends to believe that high unemployment rate____．
    A．takes job opportunities from people
    B．prevents many people from changing careers
    C．does not mean the U．S. economy is worsening
    D．should not stop people from looking for a job

33．What does the author say about overall job growth?

    A．It increases people’s confidence in the economy．
    B．It doesn’t have much effect on individual job seekers．
    C．It gives a ray of hope to the unemployed．
    D．It doesn’t mean greater job security for the employed．

   34．What is the key to finding a job according to the author?

    A．Education                   B．Intelligence
    C．Experience                 D．Persistence

35．What do we learn about The Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment data?

    A．They clearly indicate how healthy the economy is．
    B．They don’t include those who have stopped looking for a job．
    C．They provide the public with the latest information．

Dear friends, 
   In today’s world, being able to master a foreign language will be helpful in our life. Here，I’d like to share my learning methods. 
   First, I think it useful to learn grammar and remember as many useful sentence patterns as we can. I believe the more we read, the better our English will be. So I spend much time reading English newspapers and magazines after class, which helps a lot to improve my English.  Besides, TV and radio programs are also of great help. 
Learning English not only increases my awareness of foreign cultures but also helps me to communicate with English-speaking people and make more new friends. 
   However, sometimes I get discouraged because I keep forgetting words I have just learned. I’d like to use the opportunity to seek for your advice. Thank you!

　　The medical inspection of Ronald Opus's body showed that he died from a shot gun wound of the head. He had jumped from the top of a ten-storey building intending to commit suicide(自杀). As he  36   the ninth floor, a shotgun blast(枪声) through a window killed him immediately. Neither the   37    nor Opus knew that a safety net had been put up at the eighth floor level to    38   some window washers and that Opus would not have been able to complete his suicide anyway because of this.
In the room on the ninth floor where the shotgun blast went through an elderly man and his wife were arguing and he was   39   her with the shotgun. He was so upset that when he pulled the trigger（扳机）, he   40    missed his wife and the pellets（小子弹） went through the window, striking the falling Opus.
     The old man said it was his long-term habit to threaten his wife with the  41    shotgun. He had no  42   to murder her.   43   , the killing of Opus seemed to be an accident. That is, the gun had been   44    loaded.
The continuing investigation(调查) turned up a witness who saw the old couple's son loading the shotgun six weeks before the fatal incident. It turned out that the old lady had   45     his son's financial(经济的) support and the son, knowing the habit of his father to use the shotgun threateningly against his mother, loaded the gun with the   46    that his father would shoot his mother.
Further investigation showed that the son had become increasingly   47    over the failure of his attempt to engineer(密谋策划) his mother's murder. This led him to jump off the ten-storey building, only to be killed by a shotgun blast through a ninth floor window.
The case was closed as a suicide.

PART THREE: READING COMPREHENSION
    Directions: Read the following passages. Each passage is followed by several questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are 4 choices marked A, B, C and D. choose the one that fits best according to the information given in the passage. 
A

On the night of December 8, 1992, when he was standing in a parking lot talking to friends, Tracy March jumped to the top of a car, as he had done a hundred times before. This time, though, Tracy lost his balance. His head struck the ground, hard. 
	All night, Cory, Tracy’ s mother, stood next to her son, who was lying in a hospital bed, his brown eyes fixed in a lifeless stare. She remembered that Tracy has once mentioned organ （器官）donation. Maybe I can spare another family this pain, she thought. When the time came, she and her husband Bill signed the forms permitting his organs to be donated. 
	Tracy was declared dead the next day. Twenty-four hours later, in a Boston hospital, Tracy’s liver was made part of my husband, David, who was suffering from a hopeless liver disease. 
	Months later, we learned from the local organ bank that the donor’s parents wished desperately to meet someone who had gained life through the gift from their son. A meeting was arranged by the organ bank to bring together two families linked by the most bittersweet ties imaginable. 
	The meeting was risky, but worth it. We talked for 3 hours. They showed us a picture of Tracy. We learned for the first how he had lived and died. We learned something about Bill and Cory too.
	For the Marches, seeing David and knowing he was well seemed to ease their suffering. I’ll never forget seeing David’s tall figure stopped over Corry, her arms around his waist, as a mother would hug a son. For a long time they held each other tight. It was hard to know if she was saying hello or good-bye. Maybe she was saying both. 
56. We learn from the passage that Tracy died _________.
  A. on December 8, 1992						B. of brain damage
  C. 24 hours after he fell off the roof of a car		D. in a car crash
57. Tracy’s parents decided to donate Tracy’s organs because ______. 
A. Tracy told them to do so just before he died.
B.  They wanted to save others the pain of seeing dear one die.
C.  David’s life could continue in a meaningful way.
D.  They knew David was suffering from a hopeless liver disease. 
58. The meeting between the writer’s family and Tracy’s parents was arranged because _______.
A.   the writer and her husband wished to express their thanks to Tracy’s parents
B.  the local organ bank wanted to see how both families felt about the donation
C.  Tracy’s parents wanted to see someone whose life had been saved by the donation
D.   the two families were linked by the most bittersweet ties imaginable. 
59. The writer and her husband learned how Tracy died _______. 
	A. from his parents					B. from the organ bank
	C. from the hospital				D. from the doctor who performed the operation
60. The meeting between the two families helped to relieve the Marshes’ suffering because _______.
A.  they saw that David looked very much like their son
B.   they saw that David had regained health with Tracy’s liver
C.   they now had someone to share their memories of Tracy
D.   they now knew for sure they had done the right thing.
B
1.2 million road deaths worldwide occur each year, plus a further 50 million injuries. To reduce car crash rate, much research now is focused on safety and new fuels---though some electric vehicle and biofuel research aims at going faster.
　　Travelling at speed has always been risky. One advanced area of research in motoring safety is the use of digital in-car assistants(车内辅助设施). They can ensure you don’t miss important road signs or fall asleep. The use of artificial intelligence software allows these assistants to monitor your driving and make sure your phone or radio doesn’t distract you at a vital moment. Most crashes result from human and not mechanical faults.
　　Some safety developments aim to improve your vision. Radar can find obstacles(障碍物) in fog, while other technology “sees through” big vehicles blocking your view.
　　And improvements to seat belts, pedal（制动踏板） controls and tyres(轮胎) are making driving smoother and safer. The color of a car has been found to be linked with safety, as have, less surprisingly, size and shape.
　　But whatever is in the fuel tank, you don’t want a thief in the driving seat and there have been many innovations（革新）. Satellite tracking and remote communications can also come into play if you crash, automatically calling for help.
　　Accidents cause many traffic jams, but there are more subtle interplays（微妙的相互影响） between vehicles that can cause jams even on a clear but busy road. Such jams can be analyzed using statistical tools. Robotic drivers could be programmed to make traffic flow smoothly and will perhaps one day be everyone’s personal drivers, but their latest efforts suggest that won’t be soon.
61. What are researchers interested in doing as the road accidents worldwide increase to a shocking rate?
 A. They are developing faster electric vehicles.
 B. They are analyzing road deaths occurring worldwide every year
 C. They concentrate their research on safety and new fuels
 D. They are designing fully automatic cars
62. According to the second paragraph, most road accidents happen
 A. because drivers fall asleep.          B. because drives make mistakes.
 C. because of engine failure.           D. because of speeding.
63. Which of the safety development is NOT mentioned in the in the passage?
 A. Radars that can help drivers to see obstacles in fog.
 B. Devices that can help drivers to see through big vehicles.
 C. Improvements in seat belts, pedal controls and tyres.
  D. Windscreens that can help drivers to improve their vision.
64. What is NOT the purpose of innovations that use satellite tracking and remote communications?
  A. To prevent car thieves from getting into your car.
  B. To call for help when one’s car crashes.
  C. To call for help when the car gets jammed in the traffic.
  D. To track the car down when it is being stolen.
65. What is true of robotic drivers?
  A. It will take some time before robotic drivers can put to practical use.
  B. Robotic drivers are not allowed to drive on busy roads.
  C. Robotic drivers can never replace human drivers.
  D. Robotic drivers are too expensive to use.
                     C
Fran’s husband Tom had a habit of throwing his dirty socks into the laundry basket , but frequently missing by a few inches. It really frustrated Fran when she had to pick up his socks and place them in the basket. After learning the techniques of behavior modification(矫正)， Fran decided to stop nagging(唠叨) her husband and try positive reinforcement(加强). When he missed the basket, she said nothing and quietly picked up his socks. However, one day when his socks actually landed in the target, she quickly reinforced the appropriate behavior by saying, “ I really like it when you put your socks right inside the basket.” She followed this statement with a hug. Within a week, Tom was hitting the target every time, or picking up the socks by hand and placing them inside the basket whenever he missed. Consequently, an argument was avoided.
  There is an old saying that” you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar”, which is the principal behind behavior modification. Complaining to someone of doing something, whether it’s a partner or a child, often gets just the opposite response: resistance. But almost everyone respond to positive reinforcement and this approach to changing someone’s behavior takes a little patience and emotional control.
  Experts of behavior modification believe habits are learned because of reinforcement from the environment. This theory states that people will always do the behavior that results in the most favorable outcome. Even if in the doing, there are some negative effects. For instance，Fran may have learned from her mother that it really didn’t matter whether her husband’s socks landed in the basket or not. It is because she’d come along and pick them up for him. That was the favorable outcome but, if he only got negative messages from Fran for the same behavior, he didn’t have much motivation to abandon it.
  Of course for some people nothing will work, but it’s sure worth a try, for treating them with a hostile attitude probably won’t get you what you want , but it will get you a bad relationship with them.
 Positive reinforcement can be used with anyone, for any behavior, because all of us resist criticism and respond to praise. So, the next time you want someone to meet your wishes, try a little applause for the desired behavior.
66. Why does the author present Tom and Fran’s story at the beginning of the passage?
  A. To introduce the techniques of behavior modification.
  B. To show Tom is one of those needing behavior modification.
  C. To let the readers know this family.
  D. To list ways to get rid of bad habits.
67. Which of the following best fits the principle behind behavior modification?
  A. Taking no notice of one’s occasional good behavior.
  B. Praising one for his or her good deeds.
  C. Telling a child not to make the same mistakes again.
  D. Leaving a child alone when he or she does something wrong.
68. Which statement about a habit may the author agree with?
  A. Criticism contributes a lot to the formation of a bad habit.
  B. Most of our habits are formed in childhood.
  C. We can always get along with a person of good habits.
  D. A habit is usually reinforced by favorable outcome.
69. What can we learn from Paragraph 4?
  A. Positive reinforcement works on anyone.
  B. Positive reinforcement should be applied to anyone.
  C. By using positive reinforcement we don’t fail to get what we want
  D. By using positive reinforcement we can improving our relationship with anyone else.
70. The purpose of the passage is to tell us_____.
  A. how to bring out the best in others 
  B. the way to get along with others
  C. what behavior modification is
  D. the training of behavior modification

SECTION A (10 marks)
Directions： Read the following passage. Complete the diagram by using the information from the passage. Write NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS for each answer.
  
There are certain benefits of eating raw eggs, as there are dangers. Let me put both the things before you, which may help you decide whether eating raw eggs is good or not.
  One good reason for eating or rather drinking raw eggs is that  it supplies most of the essential amino acids(氨基酸) required for proper functioning of the human body. Another good reason to eat eggs is that they provide a bunch of vitamins and minerals like riboflavin, folic acid, vitamineB6, vitamin B 12, iron, choline, calcium, potassium and phosphorus. Egg is one of the few natural products that contain vitamin D. One more nutrient called choline is contained in the egg which is recommended for intake by pregnant and nursing women, as it aids brain development. The egg white is the richest source of protein on earth. This makes it an ideal protein supplement. Eating raw eggs for protein is a common practice among body builders.
  One danger from eating raw eggs is getting a salmonella infection. The danger is highly overstated, however. There is a probability of 1 in 30,000 eggs being infected with salmonella according to a study . To stay safe, you should purchase eggs from villagers who feed their chickens with organic foods. Cold storage of chicken eggs also helps to reduce the risk of infection. Another problem is that eating a lot of egg white can lead to lack of biotin(促生素). However, this problem can be dealt with if you eat the whole egg instead of just the egg white as the egg yolk is rich in biotin. The high level of cholesterol(胆固醇) in egg yolk is another risk . however， there is no convincing research on how much egg yolk cholesterol can be stored by the body. If you have heart problems, eating less is recommended.
                Title: 71._______---Good or Bad
I 72.________
*giving73.________ of most of essential amino acids for the human body to 74.______
    *providing a bunch of vitamins and minerals especially for75.______ to develop

   II. Dangers and ways to avoid dangers

*79._______due to eating a lot of egg white

SECTION B (10 marks)
Directions： Read the following passage. Answer the questions according to the information given in the passage.

Doctors say anger can be an extremely damaging emotion, unless you learn how to deal with it. They warn that anger can lead to heart disease, stomach problems, headaches, emotional problems and possibly cancer.
Anger is a normal emotion that we all feel from time to time. Some people express anger openly in a calm reasonable way. Others burst with anger and scream and yell. But other people keep their anger inside. They can not or will not express it. This is called repressing anger.
For years many doctors thought that repressing anger was more dangerous to a person's health than expressing it. They said that when a person is angry, the brain releases the same hormones (荷尔蒙)．They speed the heart rate, raise blood pressure, or sugar into the blood, etc. In general the person feels excited and ready to act.
Some doctors say that both repressing and expressing anger can be dangerous. They believe that those who express anger violently may be more likely to develop heart disease, and they believe that those who keep their anger inside may face a greater danger of high blood pressure.
Doctors say the solution is learning how to deal with anger. They say the first step is to admit that you are angry and to recognize the real cause of the anger, then decide if the cause is serious enough to get angry about. If it is, they say, “Do not express your anger while angry. Wait until your anger has cooled down and you are able to express yourself calmly and reasonably.”
Doctors say that a good way to deal with anger is to find humor in the situation that has made you angry. They said that laughter is much healthier than anger.

参考范文
Dear Jack,
I am a Senior Three student. I am Mike. Recently, students in our school carried out a survey named To Whom Do You Go When in Trouble？The results are as follows. 
61% of the students surveyed turn to their friends or schoolmates for help when they are in trouble. They think they are of the same age and have a lot in common，thus making it easier to understand each other. About one fourth of them choose teachers and parents as their ideal listeners just because they have seen a great deal of life and have many experiences. However，there are still 14% who prefer to keep the troubles to themselves. They either feel shameful to share their personal affairs or have difficulty in getting on well with others.
As far as I am concerned, I will choose to talk to my good friends. You see I always share secrets and feelings with my friends. I think that’s a suitable way for me. We can chat a lot online or face to face, which really works. What’s your opinion about this topic? 
Best wishes!

Yours sincerely，
Mike

 A   
It was Thanksgiving morning. I was busy preparing the traditional Thanksgiving turkey when the doorbell rang. I opened the front door and saw two small children in rags huddling together on the top step.
“Any old papers, lady？” asked one of them.
I was busy. I wanted to say “no” until I looked down at their feet. They were wearing thin little sandals(凉鞋), wet with heavy snow.
“Come in and I'll make you a cup of hot cocoa.”
They walked over and sat down at the table. Their wet sandals left marks upon the floor. I served them cocoa and bread to fight against the cold outside. Then I went back to the kitchen and started cooking.
The silence in the front room struck me. I looked in. The girl held the empty cup in her hands, looking at it. The boy asked in a flat voice, “Lady, are you rich？”
“Am I rich? Pity, no！”
I looked at my worn­out slipcovers(椅套). The girl put her cup back in its saucer(茶碟)carefully and said, “Your cups match your saucers.” They left after that, holding their papers against the wind. They had reminded me that I had so much for which to be grateful.
Plain blue china cups and saucers were only worth five pence. But they matched.
I tasted the potatoes and stirred(搅动)the meat soup. Potatoes and brown meat soup, a roof over our heads, my man with a regular job, these matched, too.
I moved the chairs back from the fire and cleaned the living room. The muddy marks of little sandals were still wet upon my floor. Let them be for a while, I thought, just in case I should begin to forget how rich I am. 
21．Which of the following would be the best title for the text?
A．Lady, are you rich?

A．The girl thought the writer was rich just because she wanted to make the writer happy.
B．The writer had thought she wasn't rich because her supplies were not expensive.

D．After hearing what they said, the writer seemed to understand what a rich life was.
23．The writer left the muddy marks of little sandals on the floor for a while to________.
A．show that she was a kind­hearted lady
B．remind her that she shouldn't forget how rich she was
C．leave room for readers to think about what being rich is
D．prove that she had understood what meant being rich
24．It can be inferred from the text that whether you are rich depends on________.

Traditionally, across the world, boys and girls attend a mixed school, where they study together. But boys' schools are the perfect place to teach young men to express their emotions and involve them in activities such as art, dance and music.
Boys at single-sex schools were said to be more likely to get involved in cultural and artistic activities that helped develop their emotional expressiveness, rather than feeling they had to correspond to(和…相符) the "boy code" of hiding their emotions to be a "real man".
The findings of the study go against received wisdom that boys do better when taught alongside girls.
Tony Little, head master of Eton, warned that boys were being failed by the British education system because it had become too focused on girls. He criticized teachers for failing to recognize that boys are actually more emotional than girls.
The research argued that boys often perform badly in mixed schools because they become discouraged when girls do better earlier in speaking and reading skills.
But in single-sex schools teachers can tailor lessons to boys' learning style, letting them move around the classroom and getting them to compete in teams to prevent boredom, wrote the study's author, Abigail James, of the University of Virginia.
Teachers could encourage boys to enjoy reading and writing with "boy-focused" approaches such as themes and characters that appeal to them. Because boys generally have more acute vision, learn best through touch, and are physically more active, they need to be given "hands-on" lessons where they are allowed to walk around. "Boys in mixed schools view classical music as feminine（女性的） and prefer the modern genre （类型） in which violence and sexism are major themes," James wrote.
Single-sex education also made it less likely that boys would feel that they had to be "masterful and in charge" in relationships. "In mixed schools, boys feel forced to act like men before they understand themselves well enough to know what that means," the study reported.
28. The author believes that a single-sex school would __________.
A. force boys to hide their emotions to be "real men"
B. help boys to be more competitive in schools.
C. encourage boys to express their emotions more freely
D. naturally strengthen boys’ traditional image of a man
29. It is commonly believed that in a mixed school boys __________.
A. behave more responsibly.					
B. grow up more healthily.
C. perform relatively better.					
D. receive a better education.
30. According to Abigail James, one of the advantages of single-sex schools is __________.
A. teaching can be tailored to suit the characteristics of boys
B. boys can focus on their lessons without being distracted
C. boys can choose to learn whatever they are interested in
D. teaching can be designed to promote boys' team spirit
31. What does the underlined word “acute” in paragraph 8” mean?
A. lovely				B. sharp				C. serious			D. dull
D
People are being tricked into Facebook with the promise of a fun, free service without realizing they’re paying for it by giving up loads of personal information. 
Most Facebook users don’t realize this is happening. Even if they know what the company is up to, they still have no idea what they’re paying for Facebook because people don’t really know what their personal data is worth.
The biggest problem, however, is that the company keeps changing the rules early on you keep everything private. That was the great thing about Facebook. You could create your own little private network. Last year. The company changed its privacy rules so that many things; your city, your photo, your friends’ names were set, by default (默认)to be shared with everyone on the Internet.
According to Facebook’s vice-president Elliot Schrage, the company is simply making changes to improve its service, and if people don’t share information. They have a “less satisfying experience.
Some critics think this is more about Facebook looking to make more money. In original business model, which involved selling ads and putting them. At the side of the pages totally, who wants to look at ads when they’re online connecting with their friends? 
The privacy issue has already landed Facebook in hot water in Washington. In April. Senator Charles Schumer called on Facebook to change its privacy policy. He also urged the Federal Trade Commission to set guidelines for social networking sites. “I think the senator rightly communicated that we had not been clear about what the new products were and how people could choose to use them or not to use them,” Schrage admits. 
I suspect that whatever Facebook has done so far to invade our privacy, it’s only the beginning，which is why I’m considering cancelling my account. Facebook is a handy site, but I’m upset by the idea that my information is in the hands of people I don’t know. That’s too high a price to pay.
32. What do we learn about Facebook from the first paragraph?
A. It is a website that sends messages to users who want to get married.　
B. It earns money by putting on advertisements.
C. It makes money by selling its users’ personal data.
D. It provides loads of information to its users.
33. What does the author say about most Facebook users?
A. They are unwilling to give up their personal information.
B. They don’t know their personal data enriches Facebook.
C. They don’t identify themselves when using the website.
D. They care very little about their personal information.
34. Why does Facebook make changes to its rules according to Elliot Schrage?
  A. To provide better service to its users.
  B. To obey the Federal guidelines.
  C. To improve its users’ connection
  D. To expand its business.
35. Why does the author plan to cancel his Facebook account?
  A. He is dissatisfied with its present service.
  B. He finds many of its users untrustworthy.
  C. He doesn’t want his personal data badly used.
  D. He is upset by its frequent rule changes.

A(n)   46   boy would have avoided looking at the title as soon as he saw the   47  . I did not. The subject of the English Writing Prize was kept a   48   until the start of the exam so I could not   49   reading it .
When the headmaster   50  , I was looking out of the window .
I should have told him what had   51   then. It would have been so   52   to say : “I’m sorry but I   53   the title for the English Writing Prize on your desk. You’ll have to   54   it.”
The chance passed and I did not   55   it. I sat the exam the next day and I won. I didn’t   56   to cheat, but it was still cheating anyhow.
That was thirty-eight years   57   when I was fifteen. I have never told anyone about it before,   58   have I tried to explain to myself why not .
The obvious explanation is that I could not admit I had seen the title   59   admitting that I had been looking at the things on his desk.   60   there must have been more behind it. Whatever it was, it has become a good example of how a little mistake can trap you in a more serious moral corner (道德困境).

In a world as fast-changing and full of information as our own, all of us need to know how to learn well. Yet evidence suggests that most of us don’t use the learning techniques that science has proved the most effective. 
The scientific literature evaluating these techniques goes back to decades and across thousands of articles. It’s far too extensive and complex for the average parent, teacher or employer to look through. Fortunately, a team of five leading psychologists have done the job for us. 
Professor John Dunlosky and other psychologists closely examined 10 learning strategies and rated each from high to low utility(实用) on the basis of the evidence they’ve gathered. Here’s part of their conclusions:
In contrast to familiar practices, the effective learning strategies with the most evidence to support them aren’t well known outside the lab. Take distributed（分布式） practice, for example. This strategy involves spreading out your study time, rather than engaging in one marathon. Cramming (死记硬背）information at the last minute may allow you to get through that test or meeting, but the material will quickly disappear from your memory. It’s much more effective to look through the material at intervals（间隔） over time. 
And the longer you want to remember the information, whether it’s two weeks or two years, the longer the intervals should be. 
The second learning strategy that is highly recommended by Dunlosky is practice testing. Yes, more tests---but there not for a grade. Research shows that the mere act of calling information to mind strengthens that knowledge and aids in future retrieval (检索). While practice testing is not a common strategy---despite the strong evidence supporting it ---there is one familiar approach that captures its benefits: using flash cards. And now flash cards can be presented in digital form. Both distributed practice and practice testing were rated as having “high utility” by Dunlosky. 
24. How did the psychologists study and rate the learning strategies? 
  A. By analyzing the materials gathered in the past years. 
  B. By asking some students questions about their study. 
  C. By doing some experiments on the objects in the lab. 
  D. By asking parents and teachers to look through the articles.  
25. About distributed practice and practice testing, it’s true that ___. 
  A. many students have benefited a lot from them 
  B. they were first put forward by John Dunlosky
  C. only a small number of experts know about them 
  D. psychologists are studying whether they are effective
26. The strategy of distributed practice shows that ______. 
A. we should not study for long hours every day
  B. reviewing what we have studied is of little help
  C. the shorter the interval is, the better we’ll study
  D. doing repetition at intervals is the best way
27. The evidence shows that the strategy of practice testing ______. 
  A. is a way to use flash cards to help study
  B. is mainly used to help us remember well
  C. helps know about students’ grades in time 
  D. is a way widely used to strengthen memory 
                        C
   We often associate off-season travel with cost-cutting．You know，it’s something to be done as a last resort，not something that you actively look forward to．And it surely is reasonable，isn’t it? Off-season just seems like a polite term for depressing weather，and a lack of good conditions for traveling．Recently，however，this term has begun to gain a steady stream of followers．The so-called peak season，on the other hand，is constantly losing ground owing to the large crowds and high costs that tend to be associated with it．
   Off-season travel isn’t to everyone’s taste．So this is the time when airline companies come down to earth and offer a bunch of gifts to keep their business going on．You can mainly expect lowered fares and automatic upgrades if you’re a frequent traveler．Off-season means an encouragement for the hotel businesses as well．Ordinarily，5-star luxury is only something that we tend to dream of, but this is the perfect time to transform this into reality．Grand chain hotels cut their rates like crazy in order to fill up their rooms during this time，and worry not，the availability is fairly acceptable too．So make the most of it and book a fashionable room in a 5-star．Of course, you’re free to spend the amount you’ve thus saved in shopping．
Every season has its own charm，doesn’t it? For instance， people usually prefer to visit Europe in the summer，which is regarded as the best time to be there．But really，doesn’t it get rather sweltering (闷热) if you’re in Naples or Madrid in July? Ever spent a Christmas in either places? It’s highly recommended, if I may add．It’s the perfect quiet period vacation you’ll have．Hell，it can be the most perfect vacation you’ll ever have．
Who has ever liked to be pushed and shouldered while taking a photo during an amazing Copacabana sunset? Or have their wallet stolen in a crowded street? Off-season travel translates to privacy, peace of mind，and relaxation．

28．The author wrote the passage mainly to________________．
A．change readers’ traditional life style
B．state the advantages of off-season traveling
C．encourage readers to travel in peak seasons
D．compare the difference of traveling in different seasons
29. In Paragraph 2 the author wants to stress______________．
A．the luxury of 5-star hotels
B．the comfort of air traveling
C．the better service than that in other seasons
D．the low cost of off-season journey
30．The author suggests traveling to Europe in winter because___．
A．people usually feel bored in summer
B．people regard winter as the most charming season
C．its winter has a different charm
D．travelers can spend Christmas there
31．Some airlines cut down their flight price in off seasons because________．
A．they hope to attract more travelers
B．they wish to show their gratitude to their passengers
C．their expenses are low during this time
D．they want to make up for the loss they have experienced

                                D
Looking up over the tops of her glasses, Rosemary glanced at the kitchen clock: it was almost 10 a.m. My God! Did the boy intend to sleep all day? She noticed the pain in her wrist again, and put down her pen. Anyhow, at 87 years of age, she was glad she could still write at all. She had decided long ago that growing old was like slowly turning to stone; you couldn’t take anything for granted. She stood up slowly, painfully, and started walking to the guest room.
The trip, though only a distance of about 25 feet, seemed to take a long while. Rosemary arrived at the door to the guest room. It stood slightly open, and she looked through the opening. Victor lay sleeping on his side, his arms bent, his expression slightly pained. Get up, lazy bones, she wanted to say. Even in childhood, Rosemary had never slept past 4 a.m.; there were too many chores to do. How different things were for Victor’s generation! Her youngest grandson behaved as if he had never done a chore in his life. Twenty-one years old, he had driven down to Florida to visit Rosemary in his shiny new car, a gift from his dear parents. Victor would finish college soon, and his future appeared bright — if he ever got out of bed, that is.
Something Victor had said last night over dinner had disturbed her. Now what was it? Oh yes; he had been talking about one of his college courses —a “gut”，he had called it. When she had asked him to explain the word, Victor had said it was a course that you took simply because it was easy to pass. Rosemary, who had not even had a high school education, found the word unpleasant. If she had been allowed to continue her studies, she would never have taken a “gut” ...
The memory flooded back then, still painful as an open wound all these years later. It was the first day of high school. She had graduated from grammar school the previous year, but her father had forbidden her to go to high school that autumn, saying she was needed on the farm. After much tearful begging, she had gotten him to promise that next year, she could start high school. She had endured a whole year of chores(杂事) instead of books, with animals and rough farmhands for company instead of people of her own age. 
But when the final day came, her father was waiting for her as she came downstairs-----She was declined.
There was no arguing with Papa when he spoke that way. Tearfully, she had to drag herself upstairs to change clothes. Rosemary still wondered what her life would have been like if her father had not been waiting at the bottom of the stairs that day, or if somehow she had found the strength to disobey him...
Suddenly, Victor moved slightly, without waking, and whispered something unintelligible. Waken from her daydreaming, Rosemary stared at Victor. She wondered if he were having a nightmare.
32. By saying “if he ever got out of bed” (Para. 2) Rosemary thought Victor was______.
A. too tired to get up				B. promising but lazy
C. impolite to oversleep		    	D. old enough to help with chores
33. Why did Rosemary dislike Victor’s use of the word “gut”?
A. Because it showed that Victor didn’t take education seriously.
B. Because it reminded Rosemary of her grammar school classes.
C. Because it indicated that college courses were too easy to pass.
D. Because it implied that Rosemary was lacking in high school education.
34. Rosemary’s memory of the day when she finally prepared to start high school indicates that______
A. she had already decided to take up a job
B. she had hesitated over her choice of clothes
C. she had done especially well in grammar school
D. she had strongly desired to continue her education
35. The passage as a whole is mainly about _______.
A. whether Rosemary will go up to wake Victor up
B. Rosemary’s struggle to keep painful memories
C. Rosemary’s concern for Victor’s study
D. whether Rosemary should fight for her schooling opportunity

Do you ever feel like you are studying a mad rush of one subject after another? When things happen at such a   41    pace, it is easy to lose sight of what you are learning. It is important to   42   every now and then to think about what you have been learning. 
  Self- reflection(反思)means stopping the mad rush and   43   yourself so that your brain can evaluate what it has already  44  .Some people prefer to do their self- reflections _45 _, while others keep a journal. Either method can work, depending on what your own personal__  46   is. 
School textbooks are often divided into units. This can make it _  47   for someone to begin the process of self- reflection. Watch for the times when you complete a unit of study. Sometimes you are reminded that the unit is _48   because there is some kind of test or quiz. Use these natural     49   as opportunities to stop and reflect.
    You should find a  50    place---anywhere without noise is OK. This can even be sitting at your desk at school when you finish something   51   and the other students are still working.

Time flies! This is a third year that I have been in this school. In the past two and a half years, our school had organized many activities. That impressed me most was an activity called “Learning to Farm”. In an autumn afternoon, we were sent to a farm which we learned to plant potatoes. Having been in the city for so a long time, we were so happy to go to the countryside. After divided into three groups, we started to work. Some students cut potatoes into pieces; some dug holes, and the others put the pieces of potatoes into the hole, put the earth back and pushed them down hard. We continued doing that until all the work was done. Although we were exhausted, but we felt fulfilled on our way back home.

第二部分 阅读理解（共20小题，每题2分，满分40分）
    第一节 （共15小题；每小题2分，满分30分）
阅读下列短文，从每题所给的四个选项（A、B、C、和D）中，选出最佳选项，并在答题卡上将该项涂黑。
A
    We do not usually think about how our language works. Talking is such a natural, everyday activity that we do not often stop to consider how it actually works. When we do study our language, though, we are often surprised that we are able to understand our conversations. Words can mean so many different things. However, it turns out that the speaking situation helps a lot in making language work.
    First, the speaking situation helps make words more particular. For example, the word “dog” can describe a dog that a speaker saw in a dream. It can also be used to discuss a neighbor’s dog. No language has a separate word for the idea “dog that I saw yesterday” and another word for the idea “dog that I saw in a dream.” This is because the speaking situation makes it clear what speakers mean when they use words. So, when you have a conversation with your neighbor, the knowledge that you have a dog tells your neighbor what the word “dog” probably means in that situation.
    The speaking situation also helps make language clearer. For example, the word “bank” has two possible meanings. It can mean “a place where people keep money,” but it can also mean “the side of a river.” So the sentence “I went to the bank” is not clear. It could mean I went to the side of the river or it could mean I went to the place where my money is kept. However, if the speaker is talking about fishing or going to the mountains, others probably know that “bank” means “the side of a river.”
The things that speakers say may not always be clear. Sometimes the words are not very particular, but the speaking situation can provide the meaning. Other times words may have many meanings. Then the speaking situation limits the right meaning. This extra knowledge from the situation is very important to understand language.
    21. The passage is mainly about _____.
    A. the best time and place to talk to others 
    B. how speaking situation helps language work 
    C. what to say in difficult situations
    D. how our language works
    22.  According to the passage, we can safely say that _____.
    A.  a speaking situation does not affect the meaning of words
    B.  speaking is not very natural for most people 
    C.  a speaking situation is not important 
    D.  people often do not consider how talking works 
    23.  By using the example of the word “dog”, the writer wants to show that _____.
    A.  a word may need to be explained in a conversation
    B.  a word may have different meanings
    C.  speaking situation helps people understand the particular meaning of a word
    D.  the meaning of words is not particular
    24. According to the passage, we can know the meaning of the word “bank” by referring to _______.
    A.  the time and the place where the conversation happens
    B.  the occupation of the person who uses the word
    C.  earlier or later parts of the conversation
    D.  a reliable dictionary

B
I turned 16 on Friday, but the Driver’s License Office in my small hometown was only open on Tuesday, so I had to wait through that extremely long weekend and an endless Monday before going in for my examination.
I came to the Driver’s License Office half an hour earlier that Tuesday morning, pacing back and forth on the worn porch waiting for the office to open at eight. I reviewed the driver’s manual for the hundredth time. I was ready. I knew the manual backward and forward; I had made an “A” in my driver’s training course, and I was a genius behind the wheel.
Finally, the door opened and a weary-looking man in a brown uniform let me in. 
“Let me guess. You want to take the driver’s test.” his voice was not enthusiastic.
“Yes!” I answered in excitement.
“Ok, fill this out, and if you pass we’ll go for a drive.”
I grabbed the test and rushed to the desk where I filled it out in record time. A quick check showed that my paper was perfect.
“Let’s get in the car.” He tossed me a set of keys, and I slid behind the wheel. Everything was going smoothly as we pulled out of the empty parking lot. I signaled a right hand turn, and we were on a deserted street. This was going to be easy.
“Turn left and go up Young Blood Hill,” he ordered. My hometown is in the mountains, and Young Blood Hill was almost vertical. As I eased up the steep hill and came to a stop at the top, I heard the car’s engine die. My heart sank. I would have to start it again without rolling back down the hill. I swallowed hard and turned the key; as I moved my foot from the brake, the car began to roll. I suppose I could have rolled all the way back to the bottom except for one thing. There was something behind me which stopped my roll with a rough shake and crash of glass—a police car.
The policeman wrote me a ticket as I looked over the damage, and the man from the Driver’s License Office slid behind the wheel. I waited until we had parked before I asked how long a person had to wait before taking the test again. 
25. What time does “that Tuesday morning” in Paragraph 2 refer to?
    A. The morning when he made an “A” in his driver’s training course.
    B. The morning when he knew the driver’s manual perfectly well.
    C. The first Tuesday morning immediately after his16th birthday.
    D. The Tuesday morning right before his 16th birthday.
26. Why didn’t the car roll back to the bottom?
    A. The engine died.
    B. It hit a police car.
    C. The writer braked it hard.
    D. The man from the Driver’s License Office helped make it stop.
27. From the underlined sentence “I grabbed the test and rushed to the desk where I filled it out in record time”, we can know that ______ . 
    A. the writer didn’t like the man from the Driver’s License Office.
    B. the writer was excited and eager to go for the driver’s test.
    C. time for the test was tight.
    D. the test paper was very easy.
28. What can we learn from the last paragraph?
A. The man from the Driver’s License Office got a ticket.
B. The policeman drove the car away after the accident.
C. The writer failed the driving test.
D. The writer didn’t want to take the driving test again. 

C
NANJING, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) -- Xi Jinping and Ma Ying-jeou will shake hands in their historic meeting scheduled in Singapore on Saturday, head of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council said on Wednesday.
The two-part meeting includes one session open to the media and another behind closed doors, said Zhang Zhijun, who is also head of the Taiwan Work Office of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, when interviewed at the Zijinshan Summit for Entrepreneurs across the Taiwan Strait.

The landmark meeting is a breakthrough in face-to-face exchange and communication between the leaders across the Taiwan Strait after the relationship became strained following the events of 1949.
Zhang said the meeting will improve mutual trust and allow for an exchange of opinions on handling the cross-Strait ties.
In addition, the meeting will help strengthen the 1992 Consensus(共识), which was reached in talks between the two sides in 1992 and recognizes the one-China principle, and safeguards the peaceful development of cross-Strait ties, according to Zhang.
Zhang added that the scheduled meeting will also benefit regional peace and stability.
Also at Wednesday's summit, Chiang Pin-kung, former chairman of the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation, hailed the upcoming meeting between the two leaders as a milestone for cross-Strait ties.
Chiang told the media that he believed the meeting will give a boost to the peaceful development of cross-Strait ties.

 Researchers found that women who had given birth might have a reduced risk of death from several common conditions than those who had not, according to a study released Friday by the Imperial College London (ICL).
The study, led by ICL researchers, was published in the journal BMC Medicine. It investigates the association between the so-called reproductive factors -- such as having children and breastfeeding -- and a woman's risk of death.
Researchers analyzed data from 322,972 women across 10 countries, including the UK, France, Germany and Sweden, with an average age of 50.
Each woman was followed for an average of 12.9 years. During this period, there were 14,383 deaths overall, which included 5,938 deaths from cancer and 2,404 deaths from circulatory system diseases, according to the study.
The team compared reproductive factors with risk of death from several common conditions, such as breast cancer, stroke and heart disease.
The researchers found that women who had given birth had a 20 percent reduced risk of death than those who had not. It was also found that there was a reduced risk of death (eight percent) in women who had breastfed compared to those who did not.
The risk of death from cancer was lower in those that had given birth compared to those that had not. Within this group, the risk was reduced even further in women that gave birth to two or three children in comparison to those who had only one child.
"Hormonal mechanisms may explain the lower risk of death that we observed with breastfeeding, and having given birth, as these factors are associated with changes in hormone levels," said Dr Melissa Merritt from ICL, who led the study.
    33. According to the passage, the risk of death from cancer is the lowest in women who _______.
    A. have given birth to no child.
    B. have given birth to one child.
    C. have given birth to more than one child.
    D. have breastfed. 
    34. According to the research, if a woman has given birth and breastfed, her risk of death will decrease by_____.   
    A. 20%          B. 28%           C. 12%         D. 16%
    35. Which of the following might be one of the findings of the research?
    A. Several common conditions lead to women’s death.
    B. Reproductive factors are associated with changes in hormone levels. 
    C. Women who have given birth live longer than those who have not.
    D. Having children might reduce women’s risk of death from some diseases.

If you intend to work with this book seriously, I suggest that you give yourself every advantage by carefully following the laws of learning:
Space your learning.
36     Each session may take one half hour to an hour and a half, depending on the amount of material and on your own speed of learning. Do one or two sessions at a time--three if you’re going strong and are all involved--and always decide when you stop and exactly when you will return.
37    
Everyone learns at a different pace. Fast learners are no better than slow learners--it’s the end result that counts, not the time it takes you to finish.
Review.
When you start a new session, go back to the last exercise of the previous session, cover your answers, and see how much you remember.  38  
Test yourself.
You are not aiming for a grade, or putting your worth on the line, when you take the Comprehensive Tests.   39   You are deciding where repairs have to be made, and especially, you are experiencing a feeling of success at work that is well done.
Use these tests, as well as the abundant drill exercises, as aids to learning. No one is perfect, no one learns in the exact same way or at the same speed as anyone else.   40   And then, give yourself every opportunity to exploit your actual, latent, and potential abilities.
But most important of all, as I will remind you several times throughout this book, develop a schedule and stick to it!

    A. Do you have quick recall after a day, or you simply forget everything?
    B. This approach works better than any other method for learning words.
    C. On the contrary, you are discovering your weaknesses, if any.
    D. Every chapter of this book is divided into “sessions.”
    E. Real learning goes on only through active participation.
    F. Do not rush--go at your own comfortable speed.
    G. Find the optimum technique and speed for your unique learning patterns.

Personally I think trains are exciting and romantic. I must   41   that trains are not important means of transportation in the US, but I do have some   42   with them. 
When I was a child, growing up in a small town with very little   43  , we used to go to the station to watch the passenger trains coming in. There was something   44   about the steaming, roaring string of cars coming into view around the mountains, slowly growing larger and   45   and finally   46   crowds of strangers onto the platform. 
I took my   47   train trip when I was ten years old. I went with my elder sister to visit our cousins six hundred miles away. The train--so loud and violent on the outside--was  48    and rocking inside. We were very excited, and as that was also our first time away from our parents, we felt somewhat frightened too. However, because I had   49   so much, I was a little disappointed when I was finally one of the passengers I had   50   for so long.
As a college student, I   51   ride overnight train to my roommate’s hometown. We could never afford a   52  , so we played cards, sang, ate, read and talked   53   we finally fell uncomfortably asleep in the straight-backed seats.
My idea that trains are   54   may come from the fact that my husband and I took the train on our honeymoon, spending extra money to eat in the dining car, and   55   the window as the desert scenery slid past.
Now, when I make a trip, I always fly or drive, and   56   are not a very important part of my life.   57  , every time I hear the train whistle faraway on a quiet night, I can always feel the   58   in my heart to pack my bags and jump on board, entering a   59   world of motions, sounds, sights, and experience which just aren’t   60   in the dull environment of an airplane.

书面表达
Dear classmates,
Good afternoon!
Today is December 8th. The college entrance exams are really around the corner now. As time becomes limited and school work begins to pile up, many students start to feel much stressed --some find themselves very unenergetic and not able to concentrate; some even fall asleep in class. What should we do to avoid this?
First of all, physical exercise is the best way to reduce stress and help people relax. Therefore it is highly advisable that we have some physical exercise after some hours of mental exercise. Second, having a proper study plan is of great importance too，since it can remind us what to do and is helpful for us to do our work more efficiently. Last but not least, we should pay special attention to our diet as well. Anyway, a balanced and nutritious diet can keep a busy mind smart and energetic.
Only if we can do these three things mentioned above will we make our time of study and preparation work enjoyable, efficient and fruitful.
Thank you.

W: Good morning, Hank. It is wonderful to be back in England.
M: I’m so glad to see you again. It’s over ten years now since we left university.

Text 2
M: Can I help you?
W: I’d like to order the machines we talked about yesterday. Can I have them within two days?
M: Sure. I’ll send them by air.

Text 3
W: Where are you going to plant the tree? By the front door?
M: No, that would be silly. It’ll grow too big. I’m going to put it at the back of the garage.
W: I thought it would be better right at the other end of the garden.
M: Oh, no.

Text 4
W: I’m really angry at John. He never listens to me.
M: Take it easy, Alan. Things will work out.

Text 5
W; Bob, are you going straight home after school today?
M: No, I have a class until one o’clock, and after that I’m going to spend a couple of hours at the library before going home.

M: Hey, Let’s eat out tonight.
W: Why? You won a big prize?
M: Well, I only want to relax.
W: Really? It’s very nice of you.
M: I’ll take you anywhere you want to go.
W: Wonderful!

Text 7
W: So, how did it go?
M: Better than I had expected.
W: Didn’t I tell you that you were more fit for the job than others?
M: My education is OK. But I don’t have the experience of working on a project like this. My knowledge is mostly theoretical. That is why I am not so sure about getting this job.
W: I think what matters is that you have the ability to use your knowledge in your work.
M: I hope my interviewers feel that way.
W: Don’t you think they do?
M: I don’t know. All of them are experts in this field.
W: Don’t worry. I am sure they should call you.

M: Did you see the list of books for this course?
W: Yes, Dr. Downs said he expected us to have the first five on the list. He is going to discuss them in detail.
M: Are you going to buy them?
W: I don’t know. These books are expensive. And I don’t have a lot of money with me.
M: How about sharing them with me?
W: Sounds good.
M: Let’s do this. I will buy three and you buy two of them.
W: I would rather do it this way: We pay fifty-fifty of the books now. And at the end of the course you can take the books you find more interesting and I will take the ones like.
M: What if we both like the same books?
W: Come on, we are not going to argue over that. Are we?
M: I was just joking. It’s definitely a better idea.
W: Then let’s get the books as soon as possible.

Above 3,000people swam across a river in Guangdong Province in a move to make people more aware of environmental protection for the major waterway in south China.
The swimmers including teenagers and elders in their 60s, crossed the 450-meter-wide section of the Pearl River in Guangzhou。
Local authorities organized the swimming activity to show the pollution treatment achievement on the country’s third longest river, and make people more aware of environmental protection.
A 62-year-old swimmer said the water quality had been improved in recent years and now could match the cleanness when he swam in the river in his childhood.
A mass crossing of the river was once held in the 1970s, but for many years since then, it had been impossible for a large group of people to swim across it because of heavy industrial pollution.
Guangdong government has spent tens of millions of US dollars controlling the pollution by shutting down or moving heavily polluting factories.

                            A
   In 1826, a French man named Niepce needed pictures for his business. But he was not a good artist. He invented a very simple camera. He put it in a window of his house and took a picture of his garden. That was the first photo.
   The next important date in the history of photography was in 1837. That year, Daguerre, another Frenchman, took a picture of his reading room. He used a new kind of camera in a different way. In his picture you could see everything very clearly, even the smallest thing. This kind of photo was called a Daguerreotype.
   Soon, other people began to use Daguerre's way. Travelers brought back wonderful photos from all around the world. People took pictures of famous buildings, cities and mountains.
  In about 1840, photography was developed. Then photographers could take pictures of people and moving things. That was not simple. The photographers had to carry a lot of films and other machines. But this did not stop them, for example, some in the United States worked so hard.
   Mathew Brady was a famous American photographer. He took many pictures of great people. The pictures were unusual because they were very lifelike.
   Photography also became one kind of art by the end of the 19th century. Some photos were not just copies of the real world. They showed our feelings, like other kinds of art.
    21. The first photo was a picture of Niepce's _______.
    A. business
    B. house 
    C. garden
    D. window
    22. The Daguerreotype was _______. 
    A. a Frenchman 
    B. a kind of picture
    C. a kind of camera
    D. a photographer
    23. This passage tells us_______. 
    A. how photography was developed
    B. how to show you ideas and feelings in pictures
    C. how to take pictures in the world
    D. how to use different cameras

   There is growing concern about food insecurity in the developing world. Rising food prices, weather emergencies and political problems are deepening the struggle for families in many countries.
   Three UN agencies have published a report recently, saying high prices are likely to continue. Gregory Barrow, who is with the World Food Program in Rome, says, “If you look at the places where the World Food Program works, particularly in developing countries, you see people who might be spending more than 60 percent of their salary in purchasing food for their families.”
   East Africa is suffering its worst drought in years. In Kenya, at least three and a half million people are going hungry, mostly in the north. Yet food is going to waste in central Kenya. Now, farmers there want the government to buy their food and give it to those in need. Farmers say bad roads and lack of transportation make it difficult for them to get their produce to the market.
   Mr. Barrow says, “It needs the government to make some arrangements such as providing transport. They can buy it at a good price, then give it to those people instead of asking for food from overseas, which is very bad. When we are throwing away food, they are asking for food from overseas.”
   Economists say that imports reduce local food prices, decrease productivity(生产效率) and increase the dependency on other countries. Farmers in Kenya hope the government can pay higher prices for their crops so that they can feed more Kenyans. 
    28. What is the best title for this passage?
    A. Kenya Imports Food from Abroad
    B. World Food Program in Rome.
    C. The Poor Suffer from High Food Prices.
    D. A Report Published by Three UN Agencies.
    29. What do we know about Kenya from the passage?
    A. The people in central Kenya are suffering from hunger.
    B. At least three and a half million Kenyans lack food.
    C. The Kenyan government wants to improve road conditions.
    D. People in northern Kenya refuse to ask for food from overseas.
    30. What does “they” in the fourth paragraph refer to? 
    A. The people of northern Kenya.
    B. Government officials.
    C. The farmers of central Kenya.
    D. Kenyan economists.
    31. Which of the following statements is TRUE, according to this passage?
    A. Gregory Barrow suggests that Kenya make good use of overseas food.
    B. People in northern Kenya are suffering the drought less than the central.
    C. Economists believe importing food from abroad may cause problems.
D. Kenyan government hopes to buy the native crops at higher prices.
                            D        
   Hunan Satellite TV is losing its leading position? There's a reason for saying this. In 2012, the reality talent show, the Voice of China, on the Zhejiang Television became the most popular program in China. 
   The reason for its popularity was really because of its excellent quality? Or can we assume that without any opponent, 

we can't tell a contestant is winning because he is really talented or because there is no     comparison?
    The administrative department really contributed a lot in the popularity of the Voice of China. In the past, there were no other draft shows(选秀节目) ranked as high as Super Girl and Super Boy. Even though there were some draft shows which seemed to share the popularity, it never turned out true. All the other draft shows were shadowed by the ones on Hunan TV. One example was that since draft shows of Hunan TV were broadcast on Friday night, the draft shows of other stations were shifted to Saturday or Sunday. However, Hunan TV didn't get their permission for broadcasting shows in 2012.
   And if this were not bad enough, SARFT did a great favor for it. SARFT issued a regulation, saying that all draft shows should be broadcast after 10:30 pm at night. Zhejiang TV declared long before the regulation that since was “no audition(海选)， no PK, no rise in rank, no voting, no champion”, its program was never a draft show. So, in 2012, all the opponents of Zhejiang TV had to broadcast their draft shows after 10:30 pm while the Voice of China was permitted to be broadcast in prime time.
If you really think about it, there's no essential difference between a draft show and the Voice of China. It also selected people from all over the country, how did they say this was different from a draft show? No PK, really? PK doesn't mean one versus one! A team versus a team is called PK too. And “no rise in rank” is just a switch of concepts because at the end of every game, some left the stage and some stayed. If there was really “no champion”, how come there was only one “good voice of China” at the final round? All these were rising in rank, in disguise(隐性).
Under such circumstances, the Voice of China even got praise. We are not saying that it is not a good show; we are saying that there's regret about the show since it had no opponent.
    32. The following factors are important in making the Voice of China popular EXCEPT _______.
    A. the unique quality of the voice of China
    B. the policy support from SARFT and the administrative department
    C. the favorable broadcasting time 
    D. the shortage of good opponents
    33. The passage mainly tells us _______. 
    A. the voice of China is not a real draft show
    B. the draft shows of Hunan Satellite TV still cause our attention
    C. the advantages of the Voice of China
    D. the reasons why Hunan Satellite TV is losing its leading position
    34. What's the author's attitude towards the voice of China?
A. supportive
B. doubtful
C. optimistic
D. hopeful
    35. Which is TRUE according to the passage?
    A. SARFT issued a regulation, saying that all draft shows should be broadcast after 10:30 pm at night.
    B. Draft shows of Hunan TV were broadcast on Sunday night.
    C. In the past, there were some draft shows ranked as high as Super Girl.
    D. The Voice of China is a program of Hunan Satellite TV.

   Parents have started to notice many benefits associated with online math and reading tutoring services. Both conventional and online tutoring offers children academic help.    36   . Here's why.
   Online tutoring, much like conventional tutoring, helps a student complete difficult assignments, and is geared toward(使适合) improving grades. This method, however, allows your children to master their studies from the convenience of home, making it more convenient for both children and parents who have a busy schedule. Since the Internet is probably already one of your children's favorite activities, working education programs into their online time is easier than convincing them to apply traditional face to face methods.    37   .These abilities are essential in today's world.
   Online tutoring also enables very individualized programs and plans. Often, people believe online tutoring is designed for the masses.    38   . Beyond that, they often accommodate your children's learning speed. Not all children learn at the same rate, and feeling rushed means that important lessons are not mastered. Online tutoring eliminates that worry because children advance when they're ready, not when a tutor suggests its time.
      39   . Students who are not self-motivated may use study time for surfing the Internet. Others need the more hands-on learning approach offered by one-on-one sessions.
   So, how do you truly identify whether online tutoring is right for you and your child?    40   . If this method is not effective, contact a local tutor or tutoring center.

    A. The online method is increasing in popularity, however.
    B. The only way is to give it a try.
    C. Online tutoring may not be for everyone, however.
    D. Learning these requirements early will help to ensure future success.
    E. However, most online tutoring programs are personally designed to match each child.
    F. The conveniences of a home-based program are more important than your child's education.
    G. Participating in online programs also enhances students' online research techniques and typing skills.

Some    61   (invent) happened in strange ways. “Potato chips” is one of them.
White Lake House was    62   restaurant in New York in the 1850s. George White was the cook there. Many highly-ranked people often came to the restaurant    63    (enjoy) his cooking.
One thing which really upset George was that a customer complained    64    the food and sent it back to the kitchen to be done over. He would often return it overcooked. He was unhappy to see the customer walk out of the restaurant    65   (angry).
On August 24, 1853, a customer returned his fried potatoes to the kitchen    66    they weren't crunchy (脆的) enough. George reacted in his    67    (usually) way. He cut the potatoes very thin and cooked them in hot oil. They were so crunchy and George was sure that the man would refuse to eat them. Instead, the man loved them. He even    68   (order) more.
 Now, do you know    69    invented the potato chips? It's George White! He later set up his own restaurant. He named it George's House. He put baskets of his potato chips on all the tables. They made his restaurant a very popular place.
 Today, potato chips are one of Americans'   70    (favor) foods!

Hi Worried:
     I’m sorry to know that you’re having such a bad time at the moment. The truth is everyone will have one of those periods when things seem to be wrong, so you don’t have to worry so much. The important thing is to learn to control your temper so that you may not do or say anything you’ll regret. Here are three useful tips:
     First, talk to someone you trust about how you feel. This is a good way of letting your anger out without hurting others or yourself. Second, go outdoors and play team games with your friends，as physical exercise is an effective way to get rid of anger .And third, remain optimistic about your future. Such a positive attitude towards life can be helpful in lifting your spirits.
     I hope you’ll soon feel calmer and carry on as normal.
                                                               Yours，
                                                            Mike

第一节  （共15小题; 每小题2分，满分30分）
  阅读下列短文 ，从每题所给的四个选项 （A 、B 、C  和 D ）中 ，选出最佳选项。
A
   A store that sells husbands has just opened in Ottawa where a woman may go to choose a husband from many men.
    The store consisted of 6 floors and the men increase in positive attributes（品质，特点）as the shopper goes up the flights. There is, however, a catch（陷阱）. As you open the door to any floor you may choose a man from that floor, but if you go up a floor, you cannot go back down except to exit the building.
   So a woman goes to the shopping center to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads: Floor 1— These men have jobs. The woman reads the sign and says to herself, “Well, that’s better than my last boyfriend, but I wonder what’s further up?”
   So up she goes. The second floor sign reads: Floor 2 — These men have jobs and love kids. The woman remarks to herself, “That’s great, but I wonder what’s further up?” 
   And up she goes again. The third floor sign reads: Floor 3 — These men have jobs, love kids and are extremely good-looking. “Hmm, better.”  
   The fourth floor sign reads: Floor 4 — These men have jobs, love kids, are extremely good-looking and help with the housework. “Wow!” exclaims the woman, “Very tempting. But, there must be more, further up!”
   And again she heads up another flight. The fifth floor sign reads: Floor 5 —These men have jobs, love kids, are extremely good-looking, help with the housework and have a strong romantic character. “ Oh, mercy me! But just think…what must be awaiting me further on?”

   Death is natural, but do you have any idea of the process of dying? Modern scientists divide the process of dying into two stages---clinical or temporary death and biological death. Clinical death occurs when the vital organs, such as the heart or lungs, have ceased to function, but have not suffered permanent damage. The organism can still be revived(复活). Biological death occurs when changes in the organism lead to the “breaking up” of vital cells and tissues. Death is then unchangeable and final.
   Scientists have been seeking a way to lengthen the period of clinical death so that the organism can remain alive before biological death occurs. The best method developed so far involves cooling of the organism, combined with narcotic（麻醉的) sleep. By slowing down the body’s metabolism(新陈代谢), cooling delays the processes leading to biological death.
   To illustrate how this works, scientists performed an experiment on a six-year-old female monkey called Keta. The scientist put Keta to sleep with a narcotic. Then they surrounded her body with ice-bags and began checking her body temperature. When it had dropped to 28 degrees the scientists began draining（流光） blood from an artery（动脉）. The monkey’s blood pressure decreased and an hour later both the heart and breathing stopped: clinical death set in. For twenty minutes Keta remained in this state. Her temperature dropped to 22 degrees. At this point the scientists pumped blood into an artery in the direction of the heart and started artificial breathing. After two minutes Keta’s heart became active once more. After fifteen minutes, spontaneous(自发的)breathing began, and after four hours Keta opened her eyes and lifted her head. After six hours, when the scientists tried to give her a penicillin injection, Keta seized the syringe（注射器）and ran with it around the room. Her behavior differed little from that of a healthy animal.
24. For a person who suffers from the clinical death ___________.       
   A. he still has the possibility of getting back to life
   B. his most important organs are damaged.
   C. he can not avoid final death.
   D. he is still very much alive
25. Scientists try to make the time of clinical death longer in order to___________.    
   A. slow down the body’s metabolism.
   B. bring vital cells and tissues back to active life.
   C. delay the coming of biological death.
D. cool the organism.
26. How did the scientists put Keta into clinical death?
   A. By surrounding her body with ice-bags and draining her blood.
   B. By lowing her blood pressure and stopping her heart from beating.
   C. By draining her blood, lowering her blood pressure and stopping her breathing.
   D. By putting her to sleep, lowering her temperature and draining her blood.
27.All of the following indicate that the monkey has almost restored to her original physical state    
   except the fact that___________.   
   A. her heart beat again.
   B. she regained her normal breath.
   C. she rejected a penicillin injection.
   D. she acted as lively as a healthy monkey.
                                   C                                                                	“OK,” I said to my daughter as she bent over her afternoon bowl of rice. “What’s going on with you and your friend J.? ” J. is the leader of a group of third-graders at her camp—a position Lucy herself occupied the previous summer. Now she’s the one on the outs. and every day at snack time, she tells me all about it, while I offer the unhelpful advice all summer long.
   “She’s fond of giving orders, “Lucy complained. “She’s turning everyone against me. She’s mean. And she’s fat.” “Excuse me,” I said, struggling for calm. “What did you just say?” “She’s fat.” Lucy mumbled (含糊地说). “We’re going upstairs,” I said, my voice cold. “We’re going to discuss this.” And up we went. I’d spent the nine years since her birth getting ready for this day, the day we’d have the conversation about this horrible word. I knew exactly what to say to the girl on the receiving end of the teasing, but in all of my imaginings, it never once occurred to me that my daughter would be the one who used the F word—Fat.
   My daughter sat on her bed, and I sat beside her. “How would you feel if someone made fun of you for something that wasn’t your fault?” I began. “She could stop eating so much,” Lucy mumbled, mouthing the simple advice a thousand doctors have given overweight women for years.
   “It’s not always that easy,” I said. “Everyone’s different in terms of how they treat food.” Lucy looked at me, waiting for me to go on. I opened my mouth, then closed it. Should I tell her that, in teasing a woman’s weight, she’s joined the long tradition of critics? Should I tell her I didn’t cry when someone posted my picture and commented, “I’m sorry, but aren’t authors who write books marketed to young women supposed to be pretty?”
   Does she need to know, now, that life isn’t fair? I feel her eyes on me, waiting for an answer I don’t have. Words are my tools. Stories are my job. It’s possible she’ll remember what I say forever, and I have no idea what to say.
   So I tell her the only thing I can come up with that is absolutely true. I say to my daughter, “I love you, and there is nothing you could ever do to make me not love you. But I’m disappointed in you right now. There are plenty of reasons for not liking someone. What she looks like isn’t one of them.” 
   Lucy nods, tears on her cheeks. “I won’t say that again,” she tells me, and I pull her close, pressing my nose against her hair. As we sit there together, I pray for her to be smart and strong. I pray for her to find friends, work she loves, a partner who loves her. And still, always, I pray that she will never struggle as I’ve struggled, that weight will never be her cross to bear. She may not be able to use the word in our home, but I can use in my head. I pray that she will never get fat.
28. Why does the author want to discuss with Lucy?
   A. Because she wants to offer some other helpful advice.
   B. Because she is really shocked at Lucy’s rudeness. 
   C. Because she has prepared the conversation for nine years.
   D. Because she decides to tell Lucy a similar story of her own.
29.What does the author want to tell her daughter?
   A. It is not easy to take the doctors’ advice to eat less.
   B. People shouldn’t complain because life is unfair.
   C. People shouldn’t be blamed for their appearance.
   D. She herself was once laughed at for her appearance.
30.It can be inferred from the passage that_______.
   A. the author earns a living by writing stories.
   B. the author is a fat but good-looking woman.
   C. the author will stop loving her daughter for what she said.
   D. the author’s daughter agreed with her from the very beginning.
31.The author’s attitude towards her daughter can be best described as _______.
   A. satisfied and friendly         		B. indifferent but patient

                               D
   Children’s lives have changed greatly over the last 50 years. But do they have a happier childhood than you or I did?
   It’s difficult to look back on one’s own childhood without some element of nostalgia(怀旧的). I have four brothers and sisters, and my memories are all about being with them, playing board games on the living room floor, or spending days in the street with the other neighborhood children, racing up and down on our bikes, or exploring the nearby woods. My parents scarcely appear in these memories, except as providers either of meals or of severe blame after some particularly risky adventure. 
   These days, in the UK at least, the nature of childhood has changed dramatically. Firstly, families are smaller. It is common for both parents to work outside the home and there is the feeling that there just isn’t time to bring up a large family, or that no one could possibly afford to have more than one child. As a result, today’s boys and girls spend much of their time alone. Another major change is that youngsters today tend to spend a huge amount of their free time at home, inside. This is due to the fact that parents worry far more than they used to about real or imagined dangers, so they wouldn’t dream of letting their children play outside by themselves. 
   Finally, the kind of toys children have and the way they play is totally different. Computer and video games have replaced the board games and more interesting activities of my childhood. The irony(讽刺) is that so many ways of playing games are called “interactive”. The fact that you can play electronic games on your own further increases the sense of loneliness felt by many young people today. 
   Do these changes mean that children today have a less relaxing childhood than I had? I personally believe that they do, but perhaps every generation feels exactly the same. 
32. What is the purpose of the direct question given in the first paragraph?
   A. To get people’s attention and lead in the topic.
   B. To gather people’s opinions on childhood.
   C. To show who the passage is written for.
   D. To compare the childhood lives of two generations.
33. Which is NOT a reason for the changes?
   A. Families are smaller today.	
   B. Parents worried too much about their children.
   C. Toys can be played by children alone at home.
   D. It’s too dangerous to play outside.
34. What has the writer focused on in the fourth paragraph? 
   A. Young people today shouldn’t play electronic games.
   B. Some games that young people play today aren’t really good.
   C. Computer and video games have replaced the board games.
   D. Board games are much more interesting than computer games.
35. The writer’s attitude towards the childhood changing is ________ .
   A. approving			B. unconcerned		C. objective		D.optimistic

   根据短文内容，从短文后的选项中选出能填入空白处的最佳选项，选项中有两项为多余选项。
                            Home on the Way
   People need homes. Children assume their parents’ place as home. Boarders call school “home” on weekdays. Married couples work together to build new homes and travelers have no place to call “home”, at least for a few nights.　36　　? Don’t they have the right to a home? Of course they do. 
   Some regular travelers take their own belongings like bed sheets, pillowcases and family photos to make them feel like home no matter where they are. Some stay for long periods in the same hotel and as a result become very familiar with service and attendants. 37　.Furthermore, driving a camping car during one’s travels and sleeping in the vehicle at night is just like home—only mobile! 
   And how about keeping relationships while in transit(运输中)?　38　　. Some send letters and postcards, or even photos. Others may just call and say Hi just to let their friends know that they’re still alive and well. People find ways to keep in touch. Making friends on the way helps travelers feel more or less at home.　39　　.　 
   Nowadays, fewer people are working in their local towns, so how do they develop a sense of belonging? Whenever we step out of our local boundaries, there is always another “home” waiting to be found.　40　　, we can make the place we stay “home”. 
A. Hostels（招待所） provide a clean safe place to stay while you are travelling the world
B. Others may simply put some flowers by the hotel window to make things more homely
C. Backpackers in youth hostels may become very good friends,even closer than siblings(手足)
D. So how about people who have to travel for extended periods of time
E. No matter where you go in the world,hotels are there,too
F. Some keep contact with their friends via Internet
G. Wherever we are,with just a little bit of effort and imagination

Dear Sir or Madam,
     In an advertisement I know that your company is in need of a temporary interpreter. I would like to apply for the job.
Having learned English for ten years, I can well manage it. I took great interest in English from early years, which must contribute greatly to my English level. Thanks to my fluent spoken English, I’ll be equal to the job. I once participated in an English speaking contest and finished first place and that proved my perfect oral English and enhanced my confidence. Besides, I’m outgoing and like communicating with others, and as a result, I make friends with people from all walks of life. I can keep a calm mind even facing strangers, which may assure me to be a qualified interpreter.
In a word, I’m full self-confident that I can get the position and do it well.
Thank you for your consideration. I wish to get your answer soon.
                                                    Yours faithfully
                                                    Li Hua

     第二部分：阅读理解（共两节，20小题，每题2分， 满分40）
     第一节(共15小题;每小题2分，满分30分)
A
    At the time of this story, there was a great family gathering at the castle to meet the promised bridegroom of the Baron’s daughter. An arrangement had been made between the Baron and an old nobleman of Bavaria, Berton, for a marriage between their children. It would increase the importance of both families. The initial plans had been made in the usual way: the young people were engaged without having met each other and the date set for the wedding.
    The young Count(伯爵) Von Altenburg had been recalled from the army and was on his way to the castle to meet his promised bride. Messages had been received from Wurtzburg where he was accidentally delayed. The messages indicated the day and time when he might be expected to arrive. The castle was in a fever of preparation to provide him with a suitable welcome.
    Anne had dressed with particular care. Bertha and Wilda had selected her clothing and quarreled all morning about what she should wear. The young lady had taken advantage of their arguments to wear exactly what she wanted and had chosen very well. She looked as beautiful as any young bridegroom could wish for, and the excitement made her look even lovelier. The two aunts constantly directed her, as single aunts usually take a great interest in the love affairs of others. They were giving her the final instructions on how to behave, what to say, and how to greet her intended husband.
    Hour by hour passed. The sun, which had been so warm over the rich forests of the Odenwald, was now setting along the tops of the mountains. The Baron went to the tallest tower in the castle to see if he could see any sign of the Count and his escorts.
    Once, he thought he saw them. The sound of horns came floating up from the valley. A party of men was seen far below, riding slowly along the road. It was a false alarm, for when they reached the foot of the mountain, they suddenly rode off in a different direction. The sun, by now, had set, and the bats began to fly about in the evening light. It was getting dark, and the only movement on the road was the occasional worker returning home.
21. What can best describe the bridegroom?
	A. He accepted his intended marriage arranged without his knowledge.
  	B. He was eager to meet his intended wife so he retired from the army.
  	C. He wouldn’t have been welcomed by the bride had he arrived on time.
  	D. He didn’t like the marriage so purposely delayed going to the castle.
22. Which of the following descriptions best reflects the disappointed feeling of the       
   Baron family?
  	A. The sun was so warm over the rich forests of the Odenwald.
  	B. The Baron went to the tallest tower to see if he could see any sign of the Count.
  	C. The sound of horns came floating up from the valley.
  	D. The sun had set, and the bats began to fly about in the evening light.
23. What will the author most probably write about in the next paragraph(s)?
  	A. What happened to the bride.   	B. What happened to the bridegroom.
  	C. What happened to the Baron.   	D. What happened to the aunts.
B
With the Tesla Roadster and other plug-in（插入） electric vehicles hitting the road, demand is growing for accessible refueling points to recharge them. Carbon Day Automotive, a Chicago-based company, has now demonstrated a solar-powered recharging point, known as the Solar Plug-In Station, which lets motorists easily charge their cars using electricity that has been produced without any environmental damage.
The Solar Plug-In Station went on show in Chicago as part of the city’s bid to host the 2016 Olympic Games. According to Carbon Day Automotive, the solar-powered recharging station is part of the vital infrastructure (基础设施) required for electric vehicles in Chicago and was the focus of the previous visit by the International Olympic Committee.
These solar-powered electricity points will be used daily by Chicago to fuel the city’s electric vehicles with power from the sun. By producing the electricity from pollution-free solar cells, the CO2 emissions are reduced to zero.
Solar energy and electric vehicles are a partnership that is one more step to reducing our dependence on foreign oil. Coulomb Technologies recently developed the components required for individual recharging stations, marketed as ChargePoint Networked Charging Stations. Carbon Day Automotive is the Midwest distributor for the ChargePoint stations.
The Solar Plug-In Station consists of giant solar panels (电池板) that shade the tiny ChargePoint Networked Charging Station. The solar panel is connected to an underground battery pack, ready for everyday refueling.
“Without these stations it would be like driving around in traditional cars without the availability of gas stations,” says Scott Emalfarb, CEO at Carbon Day. “The day of true plug-in electric vehicles will be here sooner than most people realize and the world needs to be ready to accommodate them.”
24. The Solar Plug-In Station was used as part of the bid to host the Olympics mainly    
   because _____.
	A. it’s a new idea and attracts people’s attention
	B. it’s environmentally friendly
	C. it makes up for the lack of electricity
	D. it brings convenience to electric vehicle users

25. We can learn from the passage that _____.
	A. the Solar Plug-In Station has gone on show internationally
	B. the Solar Plug-In Station is likely to be put to use in 2016
	C. to recharge the electric vehicles sometimes takes a long time
	D. Chicago is promoting the application of electric vehicles
26. The passage implies that with the Solar Plug-In Station becoming popular, _____.
	A. more visitors will come to Chicago
	B. the citizens in Chicago will go to work faster
	C. more space for electric vehicles is needed 
	D. the cost of electric vehicles will be lower than traditional cars
27. What would be the best title for the passage? 
	A．Chicago Will Soon Be Full of Electric Vehicles
	B．Chicago Calls on People to Buy Electric Vehicles
	C．Chicago Fights for Its Bid to Host the 2016 Olympics
	D．Chicago Shows Its Solarpowered Recharging Stations

    Britain was once regarded as a society with class distinction. Each class had unique characteristics.    
In recent years, many writers have begun to speak the 'decline of class' and 'classless society' in Britain. And in modern day consumer society everyone is considered to be middle class. 
    But pronouncing the death of class is too early. A recent wide-ranging society of public opinion found 90 percent of people still placing themselves in particular class; 73 percent agreed that class was still a vital part of British society; and 52 percent thought there were still sharp class differences. Thus, class may not be culturally and politically obvious, yet it remains an important part of British society. Britain seems to have a love of stratification.
    One unchanging aspect of a British person's class position is accent. The words a person speaks tell her or his class. A study of British accents during 1970s found that a voice sounding like a BBC newsreader was viewed as the most attractive voice. Most people said this accent sounded 'educated' and 'soft'. The accents placed at the bottom in this study, on the other hand, were regional（地区的）city accents. These accents were seen as 'common' and 'ugly'. However, a similar study of British accents in the US turned these results upside down and placed some regional accents as the most attractive and BBC English as the least. This suggests that British attitudes towards accent have deep roots and are based on class prejudice(偏见).
    In recent years, however, young upper middle-class people in London, have begun to adopt some regional accents, in order to hide their class origins. This is an indication of class becoming unnoticed. However, the 1995 pop song 'Common People' puts forward the view that though a middle-class person may 'want to live like common people' they can never appreciate the reality of a working-class life.
28. A recent study of public opinion shows that in modern Britain ________. 
	A. most people belong to middle class  
	B people regard themselves socially different 
	C. it is time to end class distinction     
	D. it is easy to recognize a person’s class
29. The underlined word stratification in Paragraph 3 is closest in meaning to ______.
	A. variety	B. division 	C. authority  	D. qualification
30. British attitudes towards accent _________.
	A. have a long tradition      	B. are based on regional status
	C. are shared by the Americans       	D. have changed in recent years
31. What is the main idea of the passage?
	A. The middle class is expanding      	B. A person’s accent reflects his class
	C. Class is a key part of British society 	D. Each class has unique characteristics.
D
“Your first home,” Laurence Yep wrote in his book, The lost Garden, “will always be the one that you remember best. I have been away from it for over twenty years, but I still go back in my dreams.” For Yep, whose father came from China, home was an apartment and the family grocery store in a neighborhood of San Francisco. It was there that he learned about patience, hard work, and getting along with neighbours.
Mr. Brown, Laurence Yep’s high school English teacher, often set high goals for his students. He was the first person to encourage Yep to write. The experience of that class changed the direction of Yep’s life. At the age of 18 Yep published his first short story, a sci-fi fantasy. He has since written many books and many kinds of books. He has retold Chinese folk stories and written for the theater. In nearly all these varied works, Yep, who is married to the children’s book author Joanne Ryder, has returned to questions he has been asking himself since childhood: What does it mean to be Chinese and American? Can one who belongs to two cultures ever feel at home anywhere?
When asked, “How has being of a Chinese by origin been important to you?” Laurence Yep replied, “As a child I wanted to be as American as possible. Then, in my early twenties, I became very interested in my Chinese roots. For years after that, I thought that my function as a Chinese American writer was to act as a bridge between two cultures. Now, though, I am not so sure that it is possible to join them together. Compared with Asian culture, American culture pays more attention to individuals and competition. The two cultures pull in opposite directions. So I see myself now as someone who will always be on the border between two cultures. That works to my benefit as a writer because now quite fitting in helps me be a better observer.”


32. According to Paragraph 1, Laurence Yep _____________.
	A. misses his first home very much
	B. goes back to China from time to time 
  	C. moved to San Francisco at an early age	
	D. once worked part-time at a grocery store 
33. We may infer from Paragraph 2 that Mr. Brown ___________.
	A. asked Laurence Yep to be a good observer 
  	B. taught Laurence Yep the value of patience 
  	C. helped Laurence Yep finish his first book 
  	D. had high expectations of Laurence Yep 
34. The last paragraph is mainly about Laurence Yep’s ___________.
	A. childhood memories 	B. varied writing styles 
	C. view of the two cultures 	D. relationship with his family 
35. Which of the following best describes Laurence Yep’s attitude to life?
	A. Learn to accept your own differences. 
	B. Put the needs of others ahead of your own. 
  	C. Work hard and you will receive many benefits. 
	D. Challenge others as you would wish to be challenged.

    It may seem pretty stressful to take a math exam. Even if you know the material, you can still get the problem wrong. Knowing how to go through your math test and check your work can save you from handing in a test full of mistakes that can be avoided. __36__
Write it out
    You can also check a math problem by writing everything out on paper. __37__ Writing out math problems reduces your chances of missing anything to the lowest possible level, which is a common cause of incorrect answers.
_38__
    Make sure your answers work by doing the opposite procedure of what your problem calls for, including the answer you got the first time around. In other words, you would use the opposite of this addition problem—subtraction (减法)—to determine whether or not your answer is the correct one.
Plugging in
You may find that a variable isn't good enough or have a problem where you have to solve for a variable (变量). _39__ This is the only real way to assure yourself that the answer you've found is correct.
Check for a reasonable answer
__40__ For example, if you get an answer in the millions and you know it should be in the thousands, you've likely misplaced a point. Go back through the work on your paper to make sure all of your formulas and calculations are correct. If everything looks okay, do the problem again and compare the result of the second try to what you've got on the first try.
	A．Do the opposite
	B．Correct the answers
	C．Plug the variable in the equation (方程) to check it out.
	D．Therefore you'll improve your grades, as well as your math skills.
	E． It also helps you to figure out everything after you have already finished the test.
	F．If the result of a problem seems to make no sense, it indicates that the answer is
      incorrect.
	G．This helps you to know what information you have and what information you
      need to solve.

    My husband and I insisted that our children were old enough to clean their rooms and make their beds. But they thought  41 . My complaints, even self-justified shouting, were always landing on  42  ears. Very often a whole hour’s scolding would end with their  43  into tears, I felt very frustrated. I realized I needed to  44  my method of “mothering”.
    One day when they were at school, I spent some time  45  their rooms. On their desks, in plain  46 , I left the cards: “Dear Bill (the other card was  47  to Sarah), your room was messy this morning and I’m sure you like it clean. Love, the Room Fairy.”  48  arriving back, the children were  49  excited to receive the little note from the Room Fairy. The next day, their rooms were fairly tidy. Sure enough, there was another note from the Room Fairy __50  for them, thanking them for their nice “gift” of a clean room and  51  asking them to play a certain violin   52  . Each day, thank-you notes would be written differently to keep the ideas  53 .
    Sometimes the Room Fairy would propose a little  54 : “If you can finish your homework and  55   your lessons before dinner, I’ d like to watch a particular television program with you tonight.” Sometimes some colored markers or other little items would be left in  56  of well-done jobs the day   57  . 
      58  I can’t remember how long “the Room Fairy” continued leaving her love notes. When they were age appropriate, we used various versions of Post-Its(贴条). The bathroom mirror became the  59  center of our home. Appointments, notices about visiting relatives, lesson schedules, and changes in plans could be posted. 
    We all benefited from and  60  the idea of sharing reminders and daily details of life through notes. I believe the true advantage of the Room Fairy notes survives in our frequent and enjoyable communication.

Text 10 
A man woke up one day and surveyed his lands. “I need to buy another horse to help with the harvest,” (18) he said to himself. And so the man set out for the market. He looked long and hard at the animals offered for sale before finally making an agreement with the owner of an expensive horse. The man would buy the horse on one condition: the owner had to allow the man to try out the animal before   paying the money. The owner was puzzled. He had never heard of such a deal before, but he agreed to the man’s request. (19) The man walked the horse home and put him in the straw yard with his other horses. He watched the animals to see how they would behave. Almost immediately, the new animal left the others and joined the laziest, fattest, and sleepiest-looking horse under the shade of a large tree. Seeing this, the man quickly led the horse back to the market. He gave the horse back to the owner and refused to buy it. (20)

Dear Mrs Smith,
I appreciate your help very well. On the first day of the camp, you came up to me while I was sitting alone. Before that, you always gave me special attention and inspired me to join activities.
As a result, I gradually got to know the other camper. Because of the help you give me that summer, my life changed. I gained so much confidence that I went back to school I became a new person. My grades improved. I became very actively and made new friends. Today, I got the letter saying I have been admitted to a college. I am proud of them. I just want to thank you for helping me overcome my shy.

Are you competitive enough to make it in America? There is an undeniable excitement about coming to study in the US, but it's not all excitement. Yes, it is America; it is the land of freedom; it's the place where different cultures clash and live together in peace. However, you guys might agree with me: it's not easy to leave home and the security of family, friends and people who love and care about us. And doing it raises some questions:  Is it worth it? Are you equal to the challenge? You might be sitting in front of your computer watching a documentary about America, which shows you the breathtaking views of skyscrapers in New York, the beautiful warm weather in San Diego, and the huge parties along the beaches of the Sunshine State, Florida.
        Just as you know, it's all true. I remember how my heart was racing the first time I visited Times Square in New York. I can't find any words in the dictionary to describe how I felt at that moment. Someday, when you get lucky and go there, you will know what I mean.
 Unfortunately, TV and movies never show the other side of what students must do to survive America. Education in the States is really different from other places. Yes, there is the traditional A, B, C, and D grading system, and you get to be on the Dean's List if you have all As on your transcript. However, these grades don't just come from your test performances. The requirements of classes in the US are much more varied and this is the biggest adjustment that overseas students have to manage.
 Some have papers that you have to write every week; others have group projects you must do with your classmates, presentations you make in the class, or research you do by yourself to prove your own idea. There comes a night when you have a couple of projects for different classes, a paper, and an exam to study for. And that night you ask yourself, “What did I get myself into？”
 I'm not trying to intimidate you, but you should know what it really is like to study in the States. One thing I can promise you is that it is worth all the hard work you put in. And the more time you give to your study, the more open doors you will have by the time you finish your degree.
24. The author wrote this passage to ________.
A. help readers prepare for studying in the US
B. warn people of the dangers of living in the US
C. promote the US education system to overseas students
D. make readers understand the benefits of studying in the US
25. According to the author, America is ________.
A. a place that he could not get used to
B. a country where students can learn freely
C. a dangerous place to live in without family or friends
D. a place where people from different backgrounds get on well
26. When the author first visited Times Square, he felt ________.
A. disappointed            B. surprised             C. excited                D. nervous
27. According to the passage, which of the following is most challenging?
A. Attending all the classes.                 B. Getting all As in the tests.
C. Writing papers every week.             D. Balancing different study requirements.

If you see a group of people dancing and singing on the street or in the railway station, you don't need to feel surprised. They are a flash mob (暴民). Who are they? Are they mobs? Don't be confused by their name. Actually, a flash mob is a group of people who gather suddenly in a public place, do something unusual for a brief period of time, and then quickly disappear.
They are usually organized with the help of the Internet or other digital communications networks. The messages may be sent to friends, who send to more people. At a predetermined time, they gather and perform some activities such as exchanging books, coming together to look at the sky, waving their hands and yelling something at the top of their voice for 30 seconds. Then, they quickly disappear before the police can arrive. Using mobile phones, the flash mob can change its place if the first one has been cancelled for any reason.
Bill Wasik, senior editor of Harper's Magazine, organized the first flash mob in Manhattan in May 2003 and the first successful flash mob gathered on June 3, 2003. Wasik claimed that he created the flash mob as a social experiment designed to laugh at fashion seekers and stress the cultural atmosphere of wanting to be an insider or part of “the next big thing”.
Flash mob gatherings can sometimes shock people. Such an activity might seem amusing and magical, but it also might frighten people who are not aware of what is taking place. Undoubtedly, flash mob can serve as good political tools and have great potential, such as using flash mob to advertise a product.
The flash mob is now becoming more and more popular. People use it to do many things. For example, in 2009, Michael Jackson’s fans took part in a flash mob to remember him. Hundreds of his fans gathered singing and dancing Michael’s famous song “Beat It” together. Flash mobs give people from all walks of life an opportunity to come together to create a memory.
28. What is NOT the feature of the flash mob?
A. It can get together quickly.                      B. It can change its place freely.
C. It can do activities suddenly.                   D. It can injure people seriously.
29. How do flash mobs inform one another?
①By using the Internet.       ②By writing letters.                ③By yelling.
④By waving hands.             ⑤By using mobile phones.     ⑥By holding a meeting.
A. ③④                      B. ①⑤                   C. ②⑥                      D. ①⑥
30. Why did Bill Wasik create the flash mob?
A. To advertise some products.                       B. To help people make friends.
C. To make fun of  fashion seekers.                D. To create some memories.
31. What can we learn about the flash mob from the passage?
A. Bill Wasik organized the first successful flash mob in May, 2003.
B. People are encouraged to take a more active part in an activity.
C. Flash mobs tend to do something illegal for a short time.
D. Flash mob gathering can frighten all the people present.
D
If women are mercilessly exploited(利用，剥削) year after year, they have only themselves to blame. Because they feel upset at the thought of being seen in public in clothes that are out of fashion, they are always taken advantage of by the designers and the big stores. Clothes which have been worn only a few times have to be put aside because of the change of fashion. When you come to think of it, only a woman is capable of standing in front of a wardrobe(衣柜) packed full of clothes and announcing sadly that she has nothing to wear.
Changing fashions are nothing more than the intentional creation of waste. Many women spend vast sums of money each year to replace clothes that have hardly been worn. Women who cannot afford to throw away clothing in this way, waste hours of their time doing with the dresses they have. Skirts are lengthened or shortened; necklines (领口) are lowered or raised, and so on.
　No one can claim that the fashion industry contributes anything really important to society. Fashion designers are rarely concerned with vital things like warmth, comfort and durability(耐用). They are only interested in outward appearance and they take advantage of the fact that women will put up with any amount of discomfort, as long as they look right. There can hardly be a man who hasn't at some time in his life smiled at the sight of a woman shaking in a thin dress on a winter day, or picking her way through deep snow in high-heeled shoes (高跟鞋).
When comparing men and women in the matter of fashion, the conclusions to be drawn are obvious. Do the constantly changing fashions of women's clothes reflect basic qualities of inconstancy(反复无常) and instability(不稳定)? Men are too clever to let themselves be cheated by fashion designers. Do their unchanging styles of dress reflect basic qualities of stability and reliability? That is for you to decide.
32. Designers and big stores always make money______.
A. by mercilessly exploiting women workers in the clothing industry
B. because they are capable of predicting new fashions
C. by constantly changing the fashions in women's clothing
D. because they attach great importance to quality in women's clothing
33. The writer would be less critical if fashion designers placed more stress on the____ of clothing.
A. cost                   B. appearance              C. comfort             D. suitability
34. According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE?
A. New fashions in clothing are created for the commercial exploitation of women.
B. The constant changes in women's clothing reflect their strength of character.
C. The fashion industry makes an important contribution to society.
D. Fashion designs should not be encouraged since they are only welcomed by women.
35. By saying "the conclusions to be drawn are obvious" (Lines 1-2, Para. 4) the writer means that______.
A. women's inconstancy in their choice of clothing is often laughed at
B. women are better able to put up with discomfort
C. men are also exploited greatly by fashion designers
D. men are more stable and reliable in character

根据短文内容，从对话后的选项中选出能填入空白处的最佳选项。选项中有两项为多余选项。
You can help your firm innovate(创新) by creating a culture in which all employees are actively encouraged to put forward ideas. But how do you get the best from people and encourage them to be at their most creative?
Stress the importance of creativity.    36   . If they don’t understand innovation can keep your firm competitive, your efforts at encouraging creative thinking risk falling flat.
Make time for brainstorming. Find some time for new ideas to come out. For example, set aside time for brainstorming, hold regular group works hops(研讨会) and arrange team days out. A team involved in a brainstorming session is likely to be more effective.  37   . You should also give individuals the space to reflect privately on their work if you think they need it.
Challenge the way staff work.    38   .  Ask people whether they have considered alternative ways of working and what might be achieved by doing things differently.
  39    .  Motivate individuals or teams who come up with winning ideas by actively recognizing creativity, for example through an award scheme. You can reward those who just have a rich flow of suggestions, regardless of whether they are put into action at work.
Act on ideas. Creative thinking is only worthwhile if it results in action. Provide the time and resources to develop and carry out those ideas worth acting on.   40     . In addition, the flow of ideas may well dry up if staff feel the process is pointless.
A. Reward creativity.
B. The problem is that our minds are lazy.
C. Be willing to make mistakes.
D. Make sure all your employees know that you want to hear their ideas.
E. Individuals within the team can test and improve the ideas together.
F. Encourage employees to keep looking at the way they approach their work.
G. Failure to do so means that your firm may fail to benefit from innovation.

       Once, long ago, there was a man who traveled from Persia to India on foot. He had   41   been to India before. When he arrived at a village, he happened upon a fruit stand. In that village, fruit was quite   42    because of the lack of water. The man was looking around at the fruits when he     43    a big basket of some very red, very long fruit. It was the cheapest fruit in the shop, not expensive at all.    44     the man walked up to the counter and asked: “How     45      per kilo?” And the shopkeeper said: “Two rupees.” Two rupees in India is     46    . The man thought to himself: “What a     47    !” So he bought a whole kilogram of the fruit and began to    48    it. But after he tried a few pieces, he screamed: “Oh, my God!” His eyes watered, his mouth burned, and his face turned     49     . He coughed and choked and gasped for breath. 
      But despite his   50     , he continued to stuff the fruits into his mouth! Onlookers     51      their heads and laughed. One man yelled: “You’re    52  , man! Those are chilies! People use them as a condiment ( 佐料 ). You don’t just eat them by the handful like that; they’re not fruit!” But the man replied: “No, I can’t     53   ! I paid money for them, and now I’ll eat them. It’s my money!”
      You probably think this man was pretty     54   , right? Nevertheless, I bet you or someone you know makes the same    55      on a daily basis. People invest money, time and effort into a relationship, business or job. Even when experience tells them that it’s not    56     , and they know there’s little hope of improvement, they still  57       because they don’t want to waste the initial investment. But this is    58   . It is no different than being the man who continued eating chilies because he didn’t want to waste the money he’d paid for them.
       Losing something is difficult, but it is important to     59     the loss and move on.    60      you’ll just keep burning your mouth on hot chilies.

High school is regarded as the best time of my life. Beside classes and homework, there has something more that I especially treasure. In order to leave the school with no regrets, I’ll make use of my limit time to review the lessons I’ve learned.
Meanwhile, I’d like to show my gratitude to all the teachers who has given me so much help in the past three years. In addition, this is necessary for me to have a talk with who might have misunderstood me, for I do care about the friendship between us. For the purpose of improving myself, I’ll ask my classmates some advice which may be of very value to me. With these thing done, I will have no regrets in my school life.

Dear Peter,
    In your letter you mentioned how to fit in the dormitory life in my school. Here I’d like to share my opinion with you .  
As is known to all, a harmonious dormitory life is of great importance to us students and benefits all
 the members.  On the one hand, we can have a good rest and put our heart into study. On 
the other hand, we will have a good mood and enjoy being together. And there are several ways to create and
 maintain a harmonious dormitory life.  Firstly, you have to evaluate your lifestyle and try to get rid of your 
dirty habits if there are any. Secondly, when an annoying situation arises, you’ll just have to learn to tolerate 
each other . Thirdly, you’ll have to share with each other and make good friends. In conclusion, we should  
try our best to build a harmonious dormitory life for the sake of good study and good life. 
Best wishes and good luck! 
                                                                       Yours,
                                                                    Li Hua

英语试卷
时间：120分钟     满分：150分
                                第一卷
第一部分：阅读理解（共两节，满分40）
第一节：（共15题，每小题2 分，满分30分）
阅读下列短文，从每题所给的四个选项（A、B、C和D）中，选出最佳选项。
                               A
Just weeks after a special memorial voyage to mark the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic, an Australian billionaire has announced plans to build an exact replica(复制品) of the Titanic,which is just as similar to the original one as possible. The Titanic replica will make its first voyage from Southampton, England to New York in 2016.
The Titanic is a famous ship that sank in 1912. The attractive story of the ocean liner(邮轮) has made millions of people interested in it around the world. It was believed to be an unsinkable ship but it hit an iceberg and sank on its first voyage. More than 1,500 people died in the sinking of the Titanic, which at the time was the world’s largest and most luxurious ocean liner.
When fully built, the Titanic II will be 270 meters (886 feet) long and capable of holding 1,680 passengers. Unlike the original Titanic which was powered by coal-fired boiler and steam engines, the Titanic II will have modern diesel(柴油机) and electric engines. Also unlike the first Titanic, the Titanic II will have more than enough lifeboats to accommodate everyone on board if something should go wrong.
When asked whether the new replica would sink, Mr. Palmer replied: “Of course it will sink if you put a hole in it. He also added “It will be designed as a modern ship with all the technology to ensure that doesn’t happen.”
When Mr. Palmer was asked if he expected his Titanic to be successful, he simply said: “At my age, you don’t really worry so much about whether you’ll make money or lose money on something, but I believe that it is worth building it.”
1. Why is the Titanic replica being built?
A. To make a voyage from Southampton, England to New York.
B. To mark the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic.
C. To realize Mr. Palmer’s dream of constructing a luxurious ocean liner.
D. Not clearly talked about in the passage.
2. What’s mainly talked about in Paragraph 2?
A. The travelling route of the Titanic.
B. A short introduction to the original Titanic.
C. The number of people on the Titanic when it sank.
D. People’s great interest in the attractive story of the ocean liner.
3. What is the difference between the Titanic II and the original one?
A. Titanic II will be powered by modern diesel and electric engines.
B. The appearance of Titanic II will be more luxurious.
C. The construction of Titanic II will be more complex.
D. The number of the lifeboats on Titanic II will be smaller.
4. What is Mr. Palmer’s attitude towards his Titanic II replica?
A. It will sink with a hole in it.               
B. It will definitely be a great success.
C. It is worthwhile to build it.                    
D. It will make him lose money. 
B
  Today's children are the "result" of the modern society. Our parents have jobs that keep them busy almost all day long. They only have a free day in a week. This doesn't allow them to keep an eye on their children.
      On the other hand, the modern society gives more freedom to the children than they could "handle". As a child, you don't know how to grow up by yourself until you reach a certain age. That is why you need school and parents to be by your side all the time. If you don't have either of them you may make a lot of mistakes. The social system of the modem society is very lenient especially with the children.
      Most of the children today are rebels(叛逆者). They are rude. They are given too much freedom by their families. This is their parents' mistake. They ought to know that the freedom they give to their children is misunderstood.
      For example it is a bad thing for a 17-year-old child to go out in the evening on weekends. Parents are also guilty of the way their children 
show up in the street or at school. The same guilt belongs to the teaching system as well. Pupils shouldn't be allowed to dress like they were on a fashion presentation at school.
      Another important fact we can think of regarding the freedom of children is their free will of spending money. Parents shouldn't allow their children to spend money on whatever they want.
      I think children are given too much freedom not only by their parents, but also by the society. The latter is more to be blamed！
5. The writer implies that parents' busy lifestyle         .
A. makes their children become independent         
B. may lead to a tense parent-child relationship
C. is harmful to their children's health              
D. is likely to create a troubled generation
6. What does the underlined word "lenient" ( in Paragraph 2 ) mean ?
A. Not responsible.             B. Not strict.         
C. Unkind.                        D. Unfair.
7. It seems that the writer agrees that students         .
 A. should stay at home on weekends                 
B. can wear trendy clothes at school
C. had better wear school uniform at school          
D. can be allowed to go out in the evenings
8. According to the writer, which of the following takes the primary responsibility for children's problems?
A. The social environment.           B. The educational system.
C. Each family.                            D. The school.
C

  Habits Of Highly Successful Students
    Never Over-Study
When you spend too much time studying you will quickly lose focus and the time spent in studying will become ‘junk time’. You think you're studying but you're just sitting there re-reading the same sentence about 100 times and you're not getting anywhere. Instead, take regular breaks.  16   Besides, it will give your mind some time to take in what you have been doing.
 17  
    Top students don't just randomly（随意地）sit down and complete work. They actually plan what they are going to do: They actually plan the time they will study and they set goals for what will be achieved. If you want to be successful, do as successful people do. Set a plan and, set a goal and stick to it, which will create a routine and a routine is the first step towards developing a habit. 18   
 Front Up To The Toughest Work First
    Many of us like to do the easy things first to build our confidence. That’s fair enough. The only challenge with this approach is that you use up your primary energy at the start of any study period and so if you are dealing with the easy parts with your primary energy your batteries will be low when it comes the time to deal with the hard part. So what happens then? 19   We all do it. We really shouldn't, though. So develop the habit of giving your primary energy to the hard tasks and completing the easy stuff last.
     20  
    Do we really have to explain this? Just turn them off for an hour, we promise the world will still be there when you log back in! Don't text your friends, don't chat while doing memory activities，don't make phone calls, just focus on what you're doing. Even if you focus on work' for 15 minutes followed by 5 mins of chatting, it’s better than 30 minutes of work while also chatting! You get that right?
  A. Taking breaks can make you get everywhere.
 B. You get tired and impatient and just give up.
 C. Positive habits decide future success.
 D. Plan Your Study
E Taking breaks will make you energetic again and refresh your mind.
 F. Get Off Social Networking Sites And Turn Off The Phone
G. Achieve Your Goal

 Pressure comes from many aspects. It may be from the heavy load of learning or from    fierce competitions, and it may also come from our teachers or parents. Pressure has much to do with the result of our studies. Too much pressure has a bad effect on our studies while a proper amount of it may help push us ahead.
Whenever I’m faced with too much pressure, I choose to do some sports or listen to some
music, which is quite beneficial to me. As for the effective way to let go of pressure, I strongly recommend that when we feel much too stressed, we stop whatever we are doing, take a deep breath, and start thinking of something positive.

第二部分: 阅读理解（共两节, 满分40分）
第一节（共15小题；每小题2分，满分30分） 
阅读下列短文，从每题所给的四个选项（A、B、C和D）中，选出最佳选项，并在答题卡上将该项涂黑。                      
                                        A
    Last Thursday, Michael and Linda stood behind large food trucks distributing meals to 4,000 homeless people for their wedding reception on the border town of Kilis. The couple had decided that instead of hosting their friends and family for a traditional feast reception, they would feed the victims from an earthquake-stricken area.
    The idea came from the bridegroom's father, Ted, who volunteers for a Turkish relief organization. For the past few years, the organization has distributed daily meals to thousands of people who've suffered from natural disasters. He approached a representative of the organization and suggested that the family cover part of the costs of feeding them for the day.
    Then he told his son, who was surprised by the suggestion, but soon won over. When he told that to the bride, she was really shocked but finally accepted because in southeastern Turkey there is a real culture of sharing with people in need. They love to share their food, their table and everything they have. And afterwards she was quite amazed about it. So, they arrived at the distribution center on Thursday to spend the day serving food and taking photographs with their grateful recipients（接受者）．
    On Tuesday evening, the newly married couple were still pleased with their decision to quit a personal celebration for one with a greater good. "It's like sharing a dinner with your friends and family who have this kind of thing on a daily basis or sharing something with people who don't even have the most basic things," Michael said. "Hopefully, this will also give the start for other wedding dinners to be held here with our brothers and sisters in need."
21. Why did so many people crowd in Kilis?
    A. To attend Michael and Linda's wedding.              B. To support the organization.
    C. To escape the damaging earthquake.                 D. To help distribute free daily meals.
22. How did the couple celebrate their wedding?
    A. They treated their friends and relatives to a big dinner.
    B. They shared their happiness with the homeless in Kilis.
    C. They afforded the entire cost of the day for feeding victims.
    D. They took photos with the grateful victims.
23. What does the underlined word "approached" in Paragraph 2 mean?
    A. took in      B. moved towards         C. came across        D. consulted with
24. We can know from the text that __________________.              .
    A. Kilis is a place which lies in southeastern Turkey
    B. Ted was a representative of the organization        
    C. Linda adopted the suggestion immediately she heard it
    D. Michael doubted if more new couples would follow him
                                   B
Most book reviews start with a heading that includes all the basic information about the book, like:
Title. 
Author.
Place of publication, publisher, date of publication.
Number of pages.
Like most pieces of writing, the review usually begins with an introduction that lets your readers know what the review will say. The first paragraph usually includes the author and title again, so your readers don’t have to look up to find this information. You should also include a very brief description of the contents of the book, the purpose or audience for the book, and your reaction and evaluation.
    Then you move into a section of background information that helps place the book in context and discusses criteria (准则）for judging the book. Next, the review gives a summary of the main points of the book, quoting and explaining key phrases from the author. Finally, you get to the heart of your review – your evaluation of the book. In this section, you might discuss some of the following issues:
how well the book has achieved its goal
what possibilities are suggested by the book
what the book has left out
how the book compares with others on the subject
what specific points are not convincing
what personal experiences you’ve had related to the subject.
It is important to use labels to carefully distinguish your views from the author’s, so that you don’t confuse your reader.
Then, like other essays, you can end with a direct comment on the book, and tie together issues raised in the review in a conclusion.
There is, of course, no set form, but a general rule is that the first one–half to two–thirds of the review should summarize the author’s main ideas and at least one–third should evaluate the book.
25．What is the most important part of a book review?
 	A．The heading.		B．The evaluation.
	C．The conclusion.		D．The introduction.
26．It can be confusing to readers if         _____ .
	A．there is no heading in a book review
	B．the book has achieved its goal
	C．the viewer’s point of view is not distinguished from the author’s
	D．the book is compared with others on the same subject
27．What is NOT suggested for a book review in this passage?
	A．Quoting from the author of the book.
	B．Providing some book information.
	C．Analyzing only the author of the book.
	D．Comparing the book with others of a similar subject.
28．The best title for this passage is “         _____”.
 	A．Steps to follow                         B．Tips for writing a book review
	C．The way to develop your idea             D．Things not to be avoided in a book review
                                         C
    The expression“a thirst for knowledge" may soon have a new meaning for millions of people who have no way to get clean water. Researchers have developed a book with specially treated pages that can turn dirty water into clean and drinkable water. They say their invention could improve the lives of many in the developing world.
    About 700 million people around the world are at risk of disease or even death because their drinking water is not clean. The water is polluted by harmful bacteria.
    The book contains 25 pages. Each page is about one millimeter thick. The pages contain very small particles (微粒) of silver. The pages can be used as filters（过滤器）to remove harmful microorganisms(微生物) that can pollute drinking water. The filter kills the organisms that pass through it.
     Pictures on the pages show the dangers of dirty water and how to use the book for those unable to read. The pages are made of filter paper. They are designed to be torn from the book. Water can be poured through the paper to be cleaned.
     Ms. Dankovich, the inventor, says each page can treat up to 100 liters of water. She recently presented her invention at the meeting of the American Chemical Society in Boston, Massachusetts. She was asked whether she had considered adding classic literature on the book's pages.
     "The idea of classic texts—that's of interest maybe later. We have discussed a little bit more exciting text. But we really haven't had the time to go through that part," she says.
     Teri Dankovich and another researcher tested the drinkable book in Bangladesh, Ghana and South Africa. The tests proved to be successful.
     Water for Life, a non-governmental organization, has provided financial support for the project.
29. What do we learn about the book from the text?
   A. It sells well around the world.           	B. It has pages with several functions.
   C. It is about environment protection.       	D. It can treat about 100 liters of water.
30. What does the underlined phrase "that part" in Paragraph 6 refer to?
   A. Classic texts.                          	B. Invention presentation.
   C. Exciting discussion.                    	D. Financial support.
31. In which country did not the researchers test the drinkable book?
   A. Bangladesh.        B. Ghana           	C. South Africa.           D. America.
32. What is the main idea of the passage?
   A. Researchers have found a way to save those being ill.
   B. Millions of people are in great need of drinkable water.
   C. Book pages could provide safe drinking water.
   D. Knowledge is as important as drinkable water.
                                            D
  Love to sink into your chairs and relax when you get to school? Then you will not be happy to hear that schools all over the world are seriously considering exchanging traditional desks for ones with no seats at all — Yes, that means you will be encouraged to stand through those already too long math and science lessons! Why would anyone even think of putting kids to such cruelty? Experts say it improves their health and helps fight obesity. While that may seem a little far-fetched (牵强的), the officials at the few schools around the world seem to agree.
 Among them are educators from the College Station Independent School District in Texas, who recently completed a week-long experiment involving 480 students across three elementary schools. The 374 kids that agreed to participate in the study were provided with a device that helped record step count and calorie consumption over the entire period.
 All 25 teachers involved in the study reported that students appeared to be more alert and concentrate better, when allowed to stand. The one thing that did surprise the researchers was that younger kids were more willing to stay standing than kids in higher grades. They believe this may have something to do with the fact that after years of being asked to “sit still”, older kids have a harder time adjusting to this unexpected freedom.
 American schools are not the only ones reporting success with stand-up desks. Four Catholic schools in Perth, Australia, which have been testing them since October 2013, have seen similar results. In May 2014, Grove House Primary School in Bradford, West Yorkshire, became Europe’s first test one, with a seven-week trial that involved the use of desks made by Ergotron in their fifth-grade classrooms. While official results are not out yet, early reactions from both teachers and students, have been extremely encouraging.
 The findings of these studies and others done previously, all seem to mean that allowing kids to move around in classrooms is a win-win for students and teachers — it helps kids get healthier and provides educators with a more engaged audience.
33. According to the teachers, older students may not like stand-up desks because ____________.
A. they are cleverer than younger students
B. they are easily tired of standing long
C. they have formed the habit of sitting	
D. they do badly in class while standing
34. What is most likely to be the result of the seven-week trial? 
A. The standing desks can’t be used at all.
B. It is good for students to use stand-up desks.
C. More tests should be done in other schools.
D. The students are different in personality.
35. Why do the teachers like the standing desks? 
A. Because the educators can draw the students’ attention.
B. Because the teachers can keep the students healthy.
C. Because the students can have a walk in the classroom..
  D. Because the standing desks can keep the students concentrated.
    第二节 ：七选五（共5个小题, 每小题2分, 满分10分）
     根据短文内容，从短文后的选项中选出能填入空白处的最佳选项，选项中有两项为多余选项。 
 	     36    Sometimes they try to get out of a class to escape a teacher they don’t like. Here is some advice to solve this problem.
Ask yourself, “What can I learn from this teacher?” Even if you don’t worship (崇拜) his or her personality or lectures, dig deep until you find a subject in which he or she is very knowledgeable. Focus on that part of the teacher’s personality, and use him or her as a tool for learning. Not only will you gain more knowledge in that subject, but a closer relationship with your teacher may help you understand one another better.    37    
Talk to students who are doing well in the class and ask them for tips, tools, and a plan of action to get along with the teacher better.    38    
If you still can’t get along, make an appointment with the school guidance counselor (辅导员). He or she will offer many tips and suggestions for you to get out of difficult teacher relationships.    39    That means they can help you and your teachers get rid of the bad impression on each other.
    40    Your parents can meet with your teacher and try to work it out.
Teachers are there for more than just homework, and they know about more than just their subject matter. They can help you learn how to function as an adult and a lifelong learner.
Undoubtedly, these will be a few teachers along the way who you will always remember and who might change your life forever.
A. If your relationship problems can’t be solved in school, then it’s time to tell your parents or guardians.
B. If you’re too shy to talk to another student, study his or her actions and behavior in the classroom and try to follow that lead.
C. Students don’t always get along well with their teachers.
D. There must be something good in every teacher for you to learn from.
E. 	Students find it easy to get along well with their teachers.
F. 	Sometimes a guidance counselor can act as a mediator between you and the teacher.
G. Guidance counselors have the right to blame teachers.

Dear Tom,
    I’m glad to hear that you are considering making up with Peter. If I were you, I would consider a bike as a birthday present for him.
    As far as I know, Peter is always in poor health so he can take more exercise by riding a bike to build up his body. In the meanwhile, you can often go outing by bike together, which is helpful to rebuild your friendship. Besides, taking a bike is an environmentally-friendly means of transport. It’s convenient for him to get around as well.
   Apart from giving him a gift, you can also adopt other means, such as travelling, seeing a movie, having dinner and going shopping. No matter what you do, being sincere is the most important. I really hope that we can be good friends forever.
                                                             Best wishes,

Are you competitive enough to make it in America? There is an undeniable excitement about coming to study in the US, but it's not all excitement. Yes, it is America; it is the land of freedom; it's the place where different cultures clash and live together in peace. However, you guys might agree with me: it's not easy to leave home and the security of family, friends and people who love and care about us. And doing it raises some questions:  Is it worth it? Are you equal to the challenge? You might be sitting in front of your computer watching a documentary about America, which shows you the breathtaking views of skyscrapers in New York, the beautiful warm weather in San Diego, and the huge parties along the beaches of the Sunshine State, Florida.
        Just as you know, it's all true. I remember how my heart was racing the first time I visited Times Square in New York. I can't find any words in the dictionary to describe how I felt at that moment. Someday, when you get lucky and go there, you will know what I mean.
 Unfortunately, TV and movies never show the other side of what students must do to survive America. Education in the States is really different from other places. Yes, there is the traditional A, B, C, and D grading system, and you get to be on the Dean's List if you have all As on your transcript. However, these grades don't just come from your test performances. The requirements of classes in the US are much more varied and this is the biggest adjustment that overseas students have to manage.
 Some have papers that you have to write every week; others have group projects you must do with your classmates, presentations you make in the class, or research you do by yourself to prove your own idea. There comes a night when you have a couple of projects for different classes, a paper, and an exam to study for. And that night you ask yourself, “What did I get myself into？”
 I'm not trying to intimidate you, but you should know what it really is like to study in the States. One thing I can promise you is that it is worth all the hard work you put in. And the more time you give to your study, the more open doors you will have by the time you finish your degree.
24. The author wrote this passage to ________.
A. help readers prepare for studying in the US
B. warn people of the dangers of living in the US
C. promote the US education system to overseas students
D. make readers understand the benefits of studying in the US
25. According to the author, America is ________.
A. a place that he could not get used to
B. a country where students can learn freely
C. a dangerous place to live in without family or friends
D. a place where people from different backgrounds get on well
26. When the author first visited Times Square, he felt ________.
A. disappointed            B. surprised             C. excited                D. nervous
27. According to the passage, which of the following is most challenging?
A. Attending all the classes.                 B. Getting all As in the tests.

If you see a group of people dancing and singing on the street or in the railway station, you don't need to feel surprised. They are a flash mob (暴民). Who are they? Are they mobs? Don't be confused by their name. Actually, a flash mob is a group of people who gather suddenly in a public place, do something unusual for a brief period of time, and then quickly disappear.
They are usually organized with the help of the Internet or other digital communications networks. The messages may be sent to friends, who send to more people. At a predetermined time, they gather and perform some activities such as exchanging books, coming together to look at the sky, waving their hands and yelling something at the top of their voice for 30 seconds. Then, they quickly disappear before the police can arrive. Using mobile phones, the flash mob can change its place if the first one has been cancelled for any reason.
Bill Wasik, senior editor of Harper's Magazine, organized the first flash mob in Manhattan in May 2003 and the first successful flash mob gathered on June 3, 2003. Wasik claimed that he created the flash mob as a social experiment designed to laugh at fashion seekers and stress the cultural atmosphere of wanting to be an insider or part of “the next big thing”.
Flash mob gatherings can sometimes shock people. Such an activity might seem amusing and magical, but it also might frighten people who are not aware of what is taking place. Undoubtedly, flash mob can serve as good political tools and have great potential, such as using flash mob to advertise a product.
The flash mob is now becoming more and more popular. People use it to do many things. For example, in 2009, Michael Jackson’s fans took part in a flash mob to remember him. Hundreds of his fans gathered singing and dancing Michael’s famous song “Beat It” together. Flash mobs give people from all walks of life an opportunity to come together to create a memory.
28. What is NOT the feature of the flash mob?
A. It can get together quickly.                      B. It can change its place freely.
C. It can do activities suddenly.                   D. It can injure people seriously.
29. How do flash mobs inform one another?
①By using the Internet.       ②By writing letters.                ③By yelling.
④By waving hands.             ⑤By using mobile phones.     ⑥By holding a meeting.
A. ③④                      B. ①⑤                   C. ②⑥                      D. ①⑥
30. Why did Bill Wasik create the flash mob?
A. To advertise some products.                       B. To help people make friends.
C. To make fun of  fashion seekers.                D. To create some memories.
31. What can we learn about the flash mob from the passage?
A. Bill Wasik organized the first successful flash mob in May, 2003.
B. People are encouraged to take a more active part in an activity.
C. Flash mobs tend to do something illegal for a short time.
D. Flash mob gathering can frighten all the people present.
D
If women are mercilessly exploited(利用，剥削) year after year, they have only themselves to blame. Because they feel upset at the thought of being seen in public in clothes that are out of fashion, they are always taken advantage of by the designers and the big stores. Clothes which have been worn only a few times have to be put aside because of the change of fashion. When you come to think of it, only a woman is capable of standing in front of a wardrobe(衣柜) packed full of clothes and announcing sadly that she has nothing to wear.
Changing fashions are nothing more than the intentional creation of waste. Many women spend vast sums of money each year to replace clothes that have hardly been worn. Women who cannot afford to throw away clothing in this way, waste hours of their time doing with the dresses they have. Skirts are lengthened or shortened; necklines (领口) are lowered or raised, and so on.
　No one can claim that the fashion industry contributes anything really important to society. Fashion designers are rarely concerned with vital things like warmth, comfort and durability(耐用). They are only interested in outward appearance and they take advantage of the fact that women will put up with any amount of discomfort, as long as they look right. There can hardly be a man who hasn't at some time in his life smiled at the sight of a woman shaking in a thin dress on a winter day, or picking her way through deep snow in high-heeled shoes (高跟鞋).
When comparing men and women in the matter of fashion, the conclusions to be drawn are obvious. Do the constantly changing fashions of women's clothes reflect basic qualities of inconstancy(反复无常) and instability(不稳定)? Men are too clever to let themselves be cheated by fashion designers. Do their unchanging styles of dress reflect basic qualities of stability and reliability? That is for you to decide.
32. Designers and big stores always make money______.
A. by mercilessly exploiting women workers in the clothing industry
B. because they are capable of predicting new fashions
C. by constantly changing the fashions in women's clothing
D. because they attach great importance to quality in women's clothing
33. The writer would be less critical if fashion designers placed more stress on the____ of clothing.
A. cost                   B. appearance              C. comfort             D. suitability
34. According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE?
A. New fashions in clothing are created for the commercial exploitation of women.
B. The constant changes in women's clothing reflect their strength of character.
C. The fashion industry makes an important contribution to society.
D. Fashion designs should not be encouraged since they are only welcomed by women.
35. By saying "the conclusions to be drawn are obvious" (Lines 1-2, Para. 4) the writer means that______.
A. women's inconstancy in their choice of clothing is often laughed at
B. women are better able to put up with discomfort
C. men are also exploited greatly by fashion designers
D. men are more stable and reliable in character

根据短文内容，从对话后的选项中选出能填入空白处的最佳选项。选项中有两项为多余选项。
You can help your firm innovate(创新) by creating a culture in which all employees are actively encouraged to put forward ideas. But how do you get the best from people and encourage them to be at their most creative?
Stress the importance of creativity.    36   . If they don’t understand innovation can keep your firm competitive, your efforts at encouraging creative thinking risk falling flat.
Make time for brainstorming. Find some time for new ideas to come out. For example, set aside time for brainstorming, hold regular group works hops(研讨会) and arrange team days out. A team involved in a brainstorming session is likely to be more effective.  37   . You should also give individuals the space to reflect privately on their work if you think they need it.
Challenge the way staff work.    38   .  Ask people whether they have considered alternative ways of working and what might be achieved by doing things differently.
  39    .  Motivate individuals or teams who come up with winning ideas by actively recognizing creativity, for example through an award scheme. You can reward those who just have a rich flow of suggestions, regardless of whether they are put into action at work.
Act on ideas. Creative thinking is only worthwhile if it results in action. Provide the time and resources to develop and carry out those ideas worth acting on.   40     . In addition, the flow of ideas may well dry up if staff feel the process is pointless.
A. Reward creativity.
B. The problem is that our minds are lazy.
C. Be willing to make mistakes.
D. Make sure all your employees know that you want to hear their ideas.
E. Individuals within the team can test and improve the ideas together.
F. Encourage employees to keep looking at the way they approach their work.
G. Failure to do so means that your firm may fail to benefit from innovation.

阅读下面短文，从短文后各题所给的四个选项（A、B、C 和 D）中，选出可以填入空白处的最佳选项。 
       Once, long ago, there was a man who traveled from Persia to India on foot. He had   41   been to India before. When he arrived at a village, he happened upon a fruit stand. In that village, fruit was quite   42    because of the lack of water. The man was looking around at the fruits when he     43    a big basket of some very red, very long fruit. It was the cheapest fruit in the shop, not expensive at all.    44     the man walked up to the counter and asked: “How     45      per kilo?” And the shopkeeper said: “Two rupees.” Two rupees in India is     46    . The man thought to himself: “What a     47    !” So he bought a whole kilogram of the fruit and began to    48    it. But after he tried a few pieces, he screamed: “Oh, my God!” His eyes watered, his mouth burned, and his face turned     49     . He coughed and choked and gasped for breath. 
      But despite his   50     , he continued to stuff the fruits into his mouth! Onlookers     51      their heads and laughed. One man yelled: “You’re    52  , man! Those are chilies! People use them as a condiment ( 佐料 ). You don’t just eat them by the handful like that; they’re not fruit!” But the man replied: “No, I can’t     53   ! I paid money for them, and now I’ll eat them. It’s my money!”
      You probably think this man was pretty     54   , right? Nevertheless, I bet you or someone you know makes the same    55      on a daily basis. People invest money, time and effort into a relationship, business or job. Even when experience tells them that it’s not    56     , and they know there’s little hope of improvement, they still  57       because they don’t want to waste the initial investment. But this is    58   . It is no different than being the man who continued eating chilies because he didn’t want to waste the money he’d paid for them.
       Losing something is difficult, but it is important to     59     the loss and move on.    60      you’ll just keep burning your mouth on hot chilies.

Dear Peter,
    In your letter you mentioned how to fit in the dormitory life in my school. Here I’d like to share my opinion with you .  
As is known to all, a harmonious dormitory life is of great importance to us students and benefits all
 the members.  On the one hand, we can have a good rest and put our heart into study. On 
the other hand, we will have a good mood and enjoy being together. And there are several ways to create and
 maintain a harmonious dormitory life.  Firstly, you have to evaluate your lifestyle and try to get rid of your 
dirty habits if there are any. Secondly, when an annoying situation arises, you’ll just have to learn to tolerate 
each other . Thirdly, you’ll have to share with each other and make good friends. In conclusion, we should  
try our best to build a harmonious dormitory life for the sake of good study and good life. 
Best wishes and good luck! 
                                                                       Yours,
                                                                    Li Hua

Dobson Ranch Housing Association
1000 Sidewinder Road
Mesa, AZ 85202
October 15
Mr and Mrs Fred Deacon 1442 Saddleback Road
Mesa, AX 85205
Dear Mr and Mrs Fred Deacon,
I am writing this letter to congratulate you on your new purchase of a house in the Dobson Ranch area. We feel that this is one of the best neighborhoods of high quality in the city of Mesa, and we are happy to be able to call you neighbors.
For your information, there are a few things we would like to tell you. One is that there are certain duties that go with living in Dobson Ranch. In order to keep property (房地产)values at the highest possible levels, we insist that everyone who lives in Dobson Ranch take care of their property. This means that the grass needs to be cut regularly, branches of the trees and bushes should be cut off, and there should be no unattractive additions to houses, nor should houses be painted in colors like red or blue. If you want to make any additions to your house, you need our permission first.
The people of Dobson Ranch also have monthly meetings to discuss various issues of concern in our community. You are welcome to attend. We typically hold meetings on the first Saturday of every month at 7: 00 PM at the Dobson Ranch Community Center. You will receive a notice via e-mail a few days before every meeting as a reminder. We hope that you will join us as much as you see fit.
Again, welcome to the neighborhood, and I look forward to meeting you soon.
Sincerely,
Juan Sanchez President
Dobson Ranch Housing Association

October 20
Dear Mr Sanchez,
Thank you very much for your letter welcoming us to the neighborhood. My wife and I appreciate your concern, and we also appreciate you letting us know about the various rules that apply to this neighborhood. Please do not worry about us. No matter where we live, we always try to be neighbors taking care to do our work properly. We too are well aware of property values. To be honest, we are actually pleased that there are regulations that must be obeyed. In the past, we have had neighbors who have not taken care of their homes and yards; at least we know that we will not have to worry about that here.
As for the meetings, thank you for your kind invitation, but I’m afraid that you probably won’t see us too often. My work takes me out of town, so when I’m not traveling, I prefer to stay home. Similarly, my wife works long hours at the hospital and prefers to spend her days off relaxing at home. However, if we have the time, we will try to make it to a meeting. Again, thank you for welcoming us.
Sincerely,
Fred Deacon

Alexandra Scott was born to Liz and Jay Scott in Manchester, Connecticut on January 18, 1996, the second of four children. Shortly before her first birthday, Alex was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a type of childhood cancer.
On her first birthday, the doctors informed Alex's parents that if she beat her cancer it was doubtful that she would ever walk again. Just two weeks later, Alex slightly moved her leg at her parents’ request to kick. This was the first indication that she would turn out to be a courageous and confident child with big dreams and big accomplishments.
By her second birthday, Alex was able to stand up with leg braces (支架).She worked hard to gain strength and to learn how to walk. She appeared to be overcoming the difficulties, until the shocking discovery within the next year that her tumors(肿瘤)had started growing again. In the year 2000, the day after her fourth birthday, Alex received a stem cell transplant (干细胞移植)and informed her mother, “When I get out of the hospital I want to have a lemonade stand.” She said she wanted to give the money to doctors to allow them to “help other kids, like they helped me.” True to her word, she held her first lemonade stand later that year with the help of her older brother and raised an amazing $2,000 for “her hospital”.
People from all over the world, moved by her story, held their own lemonade stands and donated the earnings to Alex and her cause. In August of 2004, Alex passed away at the age of 8, knowing that, with the help of others, she had raised more than $ 1 million to help find a cure for the disease that took her life. Alex’s family — including  brothers Patrick, Eddie, and Joey—and supporters around the world are committed to continuing her inspiring cause through Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation (基金会).
24. It can be learned from the text that Alex ______.
A. couldn’t walk until she was four
B. was the only daughter of the Scotts
C. held her first lemonade stand in 2001
D. was born with cancer
25. Why was Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation founded?
A. To promote her lemonade.
B. To set up a children’s hospital.
C. To attract public attention to her disease.
D. To collect money to help children with cancer.
26. What did the public do to support Alex and her cause?
A. They helped her sell lemonade.
B. They provided free stands for her.
C.	They donated money to her foundation.
D.	They donated stem cells for her operation.
27. Which of the following can best describe Alex?
A.	Stubborn.	      B. Determined.	  C. Innocent.	     D. Energetic.
C
For many years, machines have been doing work that people once did, including some difficult jobs. Search and rescue operations in dangerous environments are often seen as the first areas that will employ high technology robots. But there is another area where they may soon take jobs traditionally held by human beings: the restaurant industry.
Teams from around the world competed in early June at the DARPA Robotic Challenge Finals in California. A team from South Korea and its robot, called DRC-Hubo, won the first place in the competition. The second and third place winners were from the United States. The robots were required to drive a vehicle, climb up steps and do mechanical work. Such activities are easy for humans to perform, but more difficult for machines. Not all of the competitors were successful. The failures showed how difficult it is to design effective walking machines.
Akihiro Suzuki works at Yaskawa Electric, a company that develops robots. He says robots cannot do everything a human can, but they are able to work without becoming tired. He says robots cannot taste food, change heating levels or seasonings to get the best flavor (风味).But he says if a food can be easily prepared, a robot can repeat the same movement to reproduce the same meal.
One Japanese woman who saw the robots working wanted to bring them home. Masayo Moti says she would like to have a husband who could work like a robot. Suzumo Machinery showed its sushi (寿司)maker robot. It performs the often difficult work of wrapping the popular Japanese food. Hiroshi Monden is an official with the company. He says people all over the world now eat sushi, but there are not enough skilled workers to prepare it. He says his machine can help anyone make sushi.
28. In Paragraph 1, the author tells us ______.
A.	robots just do difficult jobs
B.	robots are sometimes dangerous
C.	robots are widely used in our life
D.	robots are gradually replacing humans
29. Why did some teams fail at the DARPA Robotic Challenge Finals?
A. Their robots cannot be applied at home.
B. Preparing food is really difficult for robots.
C. Their robots can just repeat the same movement.
D.	They failed to design effective walking robots.
30. We can infer from the last paragraph that ______.
A.	Japanese men are lazy
B.	robots are popular in Japan
C.	Japan has advanced high technology
D. robots usually take the job of making sushi in Japan
31. In which column can we probably see the text?
A. Education.	 B. Culture.	        C. Health.	        D. Science.
D
The age at which kids first fall victim to bullying (欺侮）could influence how strongly they are affected, suggests a new study. And, surprisingly, it is not the youngest kids who are hurt the most in the long term.
Bullying can have long-lasting effects, but particularly when it begins in adolescence, the researchers say. People subjected to either verbal (口头的)or physical bullying are known to be at greater risk of developing depression, anxiety disorders or to behave violently. But not everyone reacts in this way.
Children bullied for the first time	before they hit adolescence seem to get over it, but those who are bullied for the first time later on in adolescence seem to become more aggressive or are more likely to turn to drink as a means of coping. These are the conclusions of psychologist Matthew Newman and colleagues from the University of Texas at Austin, US.
The team gave questionnaires to nearly 1,500 college students regarding their experience of physical and psychological bullying before adolescence — before high school—and in late adolescence—at high school. They assessed mood and mental state, judging by signs of anxiety or depression, such as sleeplessness. The group was also questioned about how they would react to certain challenges, such as humiliation.
People who were bullied all revealed slightly higher levels of stress. But while those bullied earlier in life seemed to respond normally to provocation (挑畔), people bullied for the first time late in adolescence are more withdrawn and sensitive to violence.
There are also sex differences between those bullied for the first time during adolescence, with females more likely to react aggressively when provoked and males are much more likely to turn to alcohol to escape bad situations.
The best solution in all cases was strong social support，whether from friends, family or school. Those with no one to share their problems with suffered the most.
So perhaps it is best not to shelter children completely from bullying early on, suggests Newman. “They may get stressed, but unhealthy coping really jumps out when they are bullied for the first time later on.”
32. What	determines the	degree of bullying’s effect on people according to the study?
A.	The reason why they are bullied.
B.	The place where they are first bullied.
C. The age at which they are first bullied.
D. The person who first bullies them.
33. What	may	happen to those first bullied later on in adolescence according to Newman and his colleagues?
A. Some are likely to be more aggressive.
B. They seem to easily get over the effect of bullying.
C. Most of them will respond to bullying normally.
D. Most of them are afraid of sharing their problems.
34. What does the underlined word “humiliation” in Paragraph 4 mean?
A. Carrying out an important plan.
B.	Being made to feel ashamed.
C. Trying hard to survive an accident.
D.	Feeling hopeless in an emergency.
35. The sex differences between people bullied for the first time during adolescence are reflected in ______.
A. the support they get from the society
B.	the effect bullying has on them
C.	the way they react to provocation
D.	the type of bullying they receive

Take the opportunity to travel when studying abroad
If you’re studying abroad, then there’s a good chance that you’re living within just hundreds of miles of many fantastic destinations.   36    So you should seize the opportunity to visit places of interest. However, you shouldn’t forget that your main goal is to immerse yourself in the country where you've chosen to study, so you should explore that country the most.
•    37    This will give you an opportunity to understand the people and customs of the different regions of the country. This will also help you appreciate the art or history classes you’ve taken about your chosen country.
•    38    Not only will it make traveling more fun, but it will be safer, too.
• If you're traveling and can't stay with a friend，it’s likely that you will look into hostels, the cheaper alternative to hotels.   39    But try to book one with a friend, to watch over your belongings, and to do as much research about the hostel as you can in advance.
• Though your study abroad program will give you an amazing opportunity to travel, make sure that you still leave some time for you to spend the weekends in your city of choice.    40   
• If you do travel out of the country, always let your friends or teachers know about it in advance.
A. Travel within the country where you’re studying abroad.
B. Try to bring a travel friend or two with you wherever you go.
C. Hostels can be a fun place to stay and a great way to meet people.
D. Many students who study abroad in the fall love going to Germany.
E. Therefore you will get used to the life there and appreciate the city.
F. Book your tickets before you leave to study abroad.
G. A ticket to these places is much cheaper than it’ll be from home.

Dad hugged me. “I’m sorry, Pam. But that doesn’t change the    52   . You can read and your classmates can’t take that away from you, right?”   53    to speak, I just nodded. After Dad’s    54   , the knot (结)in my stomach went away.
Dad taught me to laugh at myself. He reminded me of the time I tried to    55    a sign painted to the floor. Another time, I    56    to eat flowers off an empty plate. When I was ten, I wanted	to ride a two-wheeled bike. I heard Dad say to Mom, “I’m not going to hold Pam back from the    57    any kid has. ” On my first attempt, I said, “Dad, what if I fall off?” His    58    was, “You’ll get on and try again.”   59   , I learned to skate, climb trees, and so on.
I wouldn’t be who I am today if it weren’t for my dad. He made the    60    for me to believe in myself.

A
Mr. Peter Johnson, aged twenty- three, battled for half an hour to escape from his trapped car yesterday when it landed upside down in three feet of water. Mr. Johnson took the only escape route-- through the boot(行李箱)。
Mr. Johnson’s car had finished up in a ditch(沟渠) at Romney Marsin, Kent, after skidding on ice and hitting a bank. “Fortunately, the water began to come in only slowly,” Mr. Johnson said. “I couldn’t force the doors because they were jammed against the walls of the ditch and dared not open the windows because I knew water would come flooding in.”
Mr. Johnson, a sweet salesman of Sitting Home, Kent, first tried to attract the attention of other motorists by sounding the horn and hammering on the roof and boot. Then he began his struggle to escape.
Later he said, “It was really a half penny that saved my life. It was the only coin I had in my pocket and I used it to unscrew the back seat to get into the boot. I hammered desperately with a hammer trying to make someone hear, but no help came.”
It took ten minutes to unscrew the seat, and a further five minutes to clear the sweet samples from the boot. Then Mr. Johnson found a wrench and began to work on the boot lock. Fifteen minutes passed by. “It was the only chance I had. Finally it gave, but as soon as I moved the boot lid, the water and mud poured in.

My best friend and I were in the shop that she owns. It was the middle of the afternoon; we were both pretty happy and making plans for the weekend, and the atmosphere was extremely relaxed, almost lazy. Suddenly a man entered the shop. We knew, somehow, that he didn’t look like one of our usual customers, but we welcomed him politely anyway. Without any hesitation he pulled something out of his coat that we did not recognize immediately, but when he ordered us to go into the back with him, there was no doubt that this “something” was a gun.
Giving us precise orders, he offended us and kept reminding us that he could shoot at any time. He looked for the money in the register, from our wallets, and then he asked for our jewelry and we gave him all he wanted. Finally he brought his “job” to conclusion and left.
When I was a child, I felt safe with my parents in my home or wherever I was not alone. Then I began to understand the news and I learnt that horrible things were happening “out there”, but I still kept thinking that those events were just other people’s worries, not mine. From the precise moment the guy walked out of the shop. I completely changed my way of relating to the world. I always look around to see which kinds of people are possibly following me. Now I usually double check everything: If I’ve locked myself in the car or in the house. I am always careful not to wear any jewelry. Whenever an unknown guy is getting too close or is trying to get information from me, I tighten up. I know that it is wrong, that not everyone is looking to attack me again.
After all, I consider myself lucky, since nothing really bad happened to me or to my friend, but what affects me is the thought of what could have happened. We could have died or he could have beaten or raped us! I know that I have to work on it because since that day I haven’t felt safe anymore. What I don’t know is where to start. Now I am sure only of one fact, that I blame this guy, not for having taken my jewelry, but for having deprived （剥夺）me of my innocence.
8. Which of the following statements best describes the main idea of the passage?
A. A joke that a stupid friend played on the writer
B. Terrible things can happen to anybody

A. The man in the shop was one of the usual customers
B. The robber took money and jewelry
C. The writer knew immediately that the robber had a gun
D. The writer was in the shop alone when the robber entered.
10. How is it that the author considers herself lucky?
A. She did not lose all her money.
B. She has never been robbed again.

Many Americans are turning to Japan, they think, a country of high academic(学术的) achievement and economic success, for possible answers. However, the answers provided by Japanese preschools are not the ones Americans expected to find. In most Japanese preschools, surprisingly little emphasis is put on academic instruction. In one survey, 300 Japanese and 210 American preschool teachers, child development specialists, and parents were asked about various aspects of early childhood education. Only 2 percent of the Japanese respondents(答问卷者)listed “to give children a good start academically” as one of their top three reasons for a society to have preschools. In contrast, over half the American respondents chose this as one of their top three choices. To prepare children for successful careers in first grade and beyond, Japanese schools do not teach reading, writing, and mathematics, but rather skills such as determination, concentration, and the ability to work as a member of a group. The huge majority of young Japanese children are taught to read at home by their parents.
Like in America, there is diversity(多样性) in Japanese early childhood education. Some Japanese kindergartens have specific aims, such as early musical training or potential(潜力的) development. In large cities, some kindergartens are attached to universities that have elementary and secondary schools. Some Japanese parents believe that if their young children attend a university-based program, it will increase the children’s chances of eventually being admitted to top-rated schools and universities. Several more progressive programs have introduced free play as a way out for the heavy intellectualizing in some Japanese kindergartens.
12. We learn from the first paragraph that many Americans believe ________.
        A. Japanese parents are more involved in preschool education than American parents
        B. Japan’s economic success is a result of its scientific achievements
        C. Japanese preschool education emphasizes academic instruction
        D. Japan’s higher education is superior to theirs
13. In Japan’s preschool education, the focus is on ________.
    A. preparing children academically
    B. developing children’s artistic interests
    C. teaching children mathematics
D.  shaping children’s character
14. Why do some Japanese parents send their children to university-based kindergartens?
A.  They can do better in their future studies.
B.  They can make more group experience grow there.
C.  They can be individually oriented when they grow up.
    D. They can have better chances of getting a first-rate education.
15. Free play has been introduced in some Japanese kindergartens in order to ________.
A.  broaden children’s knowledge
    B. train children’s creativity
    C. lighten children’s study load
    D. enrich children’s experience

参考范文：
 Yesterday evening my uncle was invited to dinner by his friends. He was so glad that he drank a lot of beers. As a result he got drunk. After the meal, he insisted on driving home by himself although his friends tried to stop him. He was winding his way in the street, but a few minutes later, his car ran into a tall tree. He was badly injured. The police came to the scene, and he was taken to hospital. Unfortunately, he had to stay in hospital for several days .Worse still he was fined by the police and his driving license was revoked. 
      Nobody could have failed to notice the fact that drunk driving has been a great problem in recent decades. We have witnessed so many traffic accidents, injuries and even deaths caused by drunk driving. For the sake of the safety of yourself and others and for the happiness of your family, never do drunk driving. In view of the seriousness of this problem, we all hope that effective measures can be taken before things get worse.

                                      A 
Editor Henry Slocum,  
I read your May 10th article in the local newspaper Honesdale Times about electronic books, or e-books. You made several good points about the disadvantage of e-books. You may have overlooked, however, some of the ways in which they are superior to traditional books. Yes, e-books 
are expensive, but they are also convenient. In addition, duo to their environment-friendly nature, e-books have the potential to change our planets for the better.  
E-books, for anyone who is unfamiliar with the term, are about the same size and shape as
regular books. They have a large screen in the middle, however, this screen shows the reader a 
page of the text that has been downloaded from a computer. Once the reader has finished reading 
the page on the e-book screen, he or she scrolls down to see a new page. The process continues 
until the entire book has been read.  
As you pointed out, Mr. Slocum, it’s great to lie on a warm, sandy beach with a book. You 
can do that just as easily with an e-book as you can with a traditional paper book. In fact, because e-books are so light, you can carry themselves. Say, for example, that you like to read on the bus. Which would you rather carry with you---a heavy 800-page novel, or an e-book that weighs only a few ounces? 
Another important advantage is offered by e-books as well. They are more environment-friendly than traditional books.  At present, thousands of trees arecut down each year to meet the publishing industry’s demand for paper. Books that don’t sell are eventually returned to the publisher 
and destroyed, This terrible waste could be avoided if everyone used e-books, which require no 
paper.                                                        Sincerely,  David Eng 
21. What does Editor Henry Slocum think about e-books? 
A. Interesting        B. Expensive       C. Convenient      D. Environment-friendly  
22. What is mainly talked about in Paragraph 2? 
A. What an e-book is                B. Why e-books are popular  
C. How e-books have developed       D. Who are the readers of e-books 
23. In David’s letter, he thinks that_______ 
A. E-books will come down in price            B. E-books come in various sizes and shapes 
C. E-books do little harm to the environment     D. E-books are no better than traditional books 
24. The main purpose of the letter is to ________
 A. explain how to read e-books               B. honor the person who invented e-books  
C. scold publishers for wasting so much paper   D. provide evidence that e-books are a good idea                            B
Monitoring the mood of a pet dog could be used as an early warning sign that an elderly owner is struggling to cope, a new report has claimed.
Researchers placed movement sensors (探测器) on dogs to track their behavior and identified 17 distinct activities, including chewing, barking, sitting and digging.
This allowed them to map the normal behavior of a healthy, happy dog, which means any changes can be monitored and could indicate an issue with their owner.
Nils Hammerla, part of the team from Newcastle University, said, “Humans and dogs have lived together in close relationships for thousands of years, which has led to strong emotional and social mutual bonds.”
“A dog’s physical and emotional dependence on their owner means that their well-being is likely to reflect that of their owner. Any changes such as the dog being walked less often, perhaps not being fed regularly, or simply demonstrating “unhappy” behavior could be an early indicator for families that an older relative needs help. This is the first system of its kind which allows us to remotely monitor a dog’s behavior in its natural setting.” 
The team of academics, who presented their findings at the 2013 UbiComp conference in Zurich, created a hi-tech, waterproof ( 防水的) dog collar for the study.
Dr Cas Ladha, who led the study, said: “A lot of our research is focused on developing intelligent systems that can help older people to live independently for longer. But developing a system that reassures family and carers that an older relative is well without intruding on (侵犯) the individual’s privacy is difficult. This is just the first step but the idea behind this research is that it would allow us to support people without the need for cameras.”
A range of dogs was used for the study, as the team needed to map distinct behaviors that correlated( 相关联的) between different breeds.
25. From the text, we know that Nils Hammerla ____________.
A. led the study and identified 17 activities of dogs  	
B. thinks some activities of dogs can reflect senior owners’ health
C. studied the relationship between humans and animals	
D. developed a hi-tech, waterproof dog collar
26 . The underlined word “reassure” in Paragraph 7 probably means ____________.
A. keep one’s word       	         B. remove one’s doubt       
C. take one’s advice         	         D.  lose one’s face
27. Which of the following is an advantage of the intelligent system mentioned in the text?
A. It can indicate that people aren’t well. 
B. It can identify different activities of dogs.
C. It monitors an elderly owner without disturbing his privacy.
D. It lets people see the dog’s behavior clearly.
28. Which of the following could be the best title for the text?
A. Dogs’ mood can be an indicator of owners’ health
B. Strong bonds between dogs and their senior owners
C. Signs that your older relative needs help
D. A special way of taking care of the old      
                                      C
Dear David,
I’m glad you would like to share your feelings with me．It’s hardly surprising that your feelings of not being “grown up” have come on strongly at this point in your life, just before you’re about to become a father．You are asking: Will I make a good father? How will I cope? I think nearly every man must have the occasional feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy before the birth．
It’s difficult, honestly, to feel grown-up unless you have something less grown-up to relate to．The boss with a hen-pecking wife may feel like a seven-year-old when he’s at home．But as he walks through the office door, and knows he’s going to be surrounded by staff for advice, he grows into a fully mature man．And I think it’s a mistake to imagine that we all feel, as we age, a kind of progress of states, from the baby to the adult．Most people feel, on Tuesday, about three years old, and on a Wednesday, around 80．
There’s a common remark that“all men are little boys”, but it’s not true．It’s more true that men often behave like little boys．But nearly all people, at some moments in their lives, are able to be greatly mature．
Once your baby arrives, you’ll soon feel less childlike．When your child tries to put its fingers into the electric plug, the adult in you will rise up to prevent it．
Comfort yourself, David, with two truths．One is that your friends laugh when they talk about this subject because they, like you, feel frightened．And remember that people who haven’t grown up don’t go around talking about the fact．
Good luck to you and your little one．
Sincerely Yours, 
Miss Advice 
29.According to the passage, Miss Advice thinks David’s self-doubt ________．
A．valuable  	B．unusual   	C．natural	  D．bearable
30. From Paragraph 2, we can learn that people’s sense of maturity ________．
A．will increase with age            B．is obviously seen at home
C．changes with different situations    D．becomes stronger with familiar people
31.Miss Advice holds that ________．
A．all men behave like little boys          B．people tend to laugh at the subject
C．men with a baby feel more grown-up    D．people enjoy talking about their immaturity
                                     D
    Silence is unnatural to man. He begins life with a cry and ends it in stillness. In between he does all he can to make a noise in the world, and he fears silence more than anything else. Even his conversation is an attempt to prevent a fearful silence. If he is introduced to another person, and a number of pauses occur in the conversation, he regards himself as a failure, a worthless person, and is full of envy of the emptiest-headed chatterbox (喋喋不休的人). He knows that ninety-nine percent of human conversation means no more than the buzzing of a fly, but he is anxious to join in the buzz and to prove that he is a man and not a waxwork figure (蜡塑人像).
     The aim of conversation is not, for the most part, to communicate ideas; it is to keep up the buzzing sound. There are, it must be admitted, different qualities of buzz; there is even a buzz that is as annoying as the continuous noise made by a mosquito (蚊子). But at a dinner party one would rather be a mosquito than a quiet person. Most buzzing, fortunately, is pleasant to the ear, and some of it is pleasant even to the mind. He would be a foolish man if he waited until he had a wise thought to take part in the buzzing with his neighbors.
    Those who hate to pick up the weather as a conversational opening seem to me not to know the reason why human beings wish to talk. Very few human beings join in a conversation in the hope of learning anything new. Some of them are content if they are merely allowed to go on making a noise into other people’s ears, though they have nothing to tell them except that they have seen two or three new plays or that they had food in a Swiss hotel. At the end of an evening during which they have said nothing meaningful for a long time, they just prove themselves to be successful conservationists.
32. According to the author, people make conversation to ______
    A. exchange ideas                    B. prove their value
    C. achieve success in life              D. overcome their fear of silence
33. By "the buzzing of a fly" (Para. 1), the author means"________”
    A. the noise of an insect             B. a low whispering sound
    C. meaningless talks                 D. the voice of a chatterbox
34. According to the passage, people usually talk to their neighbors ______.
    A. about whatever they have prepared      B. about whatever they want to
    C. in the hope of learning something new  D. in the hope of getting on well
35. What is the author's purpose in writing the passage? ________.
     A. To discuss why people like talking about weather.
     B. To encourage people to join in conversations.
     C. To persuade people to stop making noises.
     D. To explain why people keep talking.

根据短文内容，从短文后的选项中选出能填入空白处的最佳选项。有两项为多余选项。Urbanization
Until relatively recently, the vast majority of human beings lived and died without ever seeing a city. The first city was probably founded no more than 5,500 years ago. _36___. In fact, nearly everyone lived on farms or in tiny rural (乡村的) villages. It was not until the 20th century that Great Britain became the first urban society in history—a society in which the majority of people live in cities and do not farm for a living.
Britain was only the beginning. ___37____.The process of urbanization—the migration (迁移) of people from the countryside to the city—was the result of modernization, which has rapidly transformed how people live and where they live.
In 1990, fewer than 40% of Americans lived in urban areas. Today, over 82% of Americans live in cities. Only about 2% live on farms. __38__.
Large cities were impossible until agriculture became industrialized. Even in advanced agricultural societies，it took about ninety-five people on farms to feed five people in cities. __39__. Until modern times, those living in cities were mainly the ruling elite(精英) and the servants, laborers and professionals who served them. Cities survived by taxing farmers and were limited in size by the amount of surplus food that the rural population produced and by the ability to move this surplus from farm to city.
 Over the past two centuries, the Industrial Revolution has broken this balance between the city and the country. __40__. Today, instead of needing ninety-five farmers to feed five city people, one American farmer is able to feed more than a hundred non-farmers.
A. That kept cities very small.
B. The rest live in small towns.
C. The effects of urban living on people should be considered.
D. Soon many other industrial nations become urban societies.
E. But even 200 years ago, only a few people could live in cities.
F. Modernization drew people to the cities and made farmers more productive.
G. Modern cities have destroyed social relations and the health of human beings.

My husband and I insisted that our children were old enough to clean their rooms and make their beds. But they thought   41  . My complaints, even loud shouts, were always landing on    42     ears.  Very often a whole hour’s scolding would end with their    43    into tears, I felt very frustrated (沮丧的). I realized I needed to    44    my method of “mothering”.
     One day when they were at school, I spent some time   45   their rooms. On their desks, in plain   46   , I left the cards: “ Bill ( the other card was    47    to Sarah), your room was messy this morning and I’m sure you like it clean. Love, the Room Fairy.”    48    arriving back, the children were    49    excited to receive the little note from the Room Fairy. The next day, their rooms were fairly tidy.

     Sometimes the Room Fairy would  54   a little challenge : “If you can finish your homework and   55     your lessons before dinner, I’d like to watch a particular television program with you tonight.” Sometimes some colored markers or other little items would be left in    56   of  well done jobs the day   57   .
         58    I can’t remember how long “the Room Fairy” continued leaving her love notes. When they were age-appropriate, we used various versions of Post-it-notes (贴条).

      We all benefited from and   60    the idea of sharing reminders and daily details of life through notes. I believe the true advantage of the Room Fairy notes survives in our frequent and enjoyable communication.

Dear Li Hua, 
I am sorry to learn that you are feeling so nervous that you can’t sleep well at night as the College Entrance Examination draws near. But in fact, you don’t have to worry about it, and it is not as hard as you think.
In order to get over the pressure, you should live a regular life and take more exercise to keep relaxed. What’s more, you had better have a balanced diet, and milk, meat, vegetables as well as fruit are all good choices. Time permitting, you can chat with your parents or friends about how you feel
Believe in yourself and make full preparations! I am sure that you will succeed .
 Best wishes

第二部分  阅读理解（共两节，满分40分）
第一节  （共15小题；每小题2分，满分30分）
    阅读下列短文，从每题所给的四个选项（A 、B 、C和D）中，选出最佳选项，并在答题卡
上将该项涂黑。
A
    We have most friends at the age of 26 after having spent the first quarter of our lives
building up our friendship circle ,a new research has claimed.
    The research into friendship shows that our social circle peaks at 26 years and seven
months, at which we typically have five close friends. Women are most popular at 25
years and 10 months, with men hitting the friendship highest point a little later at 27 years
and three months.
    The research, by Forever Friends, shows that a third of adults (36%) meet their
closest friends while at school, with a fifth (22%) saying they meet them at work,
    Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter now also play a major role in building
new friendships. The research points out that 25 to 34-year-olds make 22 friends via
Facebook, compared to 18 to 24-year-olds who make 12, and 35 to 44-year-olds who make
just four.
    Forever Friends relationship coach Sam Owen says: "It is no coincidence that over a
third of us meet our best friends at school.  It is a key time in our lives when friendships
are growing through sharing notes, giving gifts, seeing each other regularly and laughing a
lot. As adults we can often forget how powerful these small things are and how the little
things can make a difference."
    Later in life we find ourselves losing friends. Over half of us lose friendships through
moving, while 36% say that over time they grow apart from close pals. Having children
also causes 19%to drift away from childhood friends.
    With growing pressures being put on friendships these days, it’s important to make
time for our friendships.

     One afternoon in November 1918, Moina Michael hurried through the streets of New
York. She wore a bright red silk poppy (罂粟花) on her coat collar and carried a bouquet
of 24 smaller poppies.  World War I was going on overseas. and Moina was determined to
do her part.
      Moina was a teacher at University of Georgia when the war broke out. She planned to
do more than making socks or sweaters for the Red Cross. She wanted to encourage the
soldiers before they left for war. Moina traveled to New York to care for soldiers at the
medical center at Columbia University.  There was nothing she enjoyed more than sitting
and chatting with the soldiers.  She looked at the photos of their families and brought fresh
flowers to brighten the rooms when the weather outside turned grey.
     Earlier that November morning, she found a well-known poem in a magazine, which
began ,"In  Flanders fields ,  the  pop pies blow between the crosses (十字架 ) ,  row on  row…"
      Moina had read the poem before.  She knew that John, a Canadian physician, wrote it
while treating soldiers on the battlefields of Flanders in Belgium.  The poem, remembering
the dead, always touched her. But that morning, Moina was struck by the last verse and
pictures. Soldiers with sad eyes stared at a battleground full of white crosses and bright
red poppies. "Remember us," the soldiers seemed to be speaking to her.
    Moina thought about the soldiers at the medical center-how they had left their
families and homes to protect the freedom she enjoyed each day. To Moina, they were
heroes. Silently, she made a promise. She would always wear a red poppy to remember
the soldiers.
25. Which of the following can best replace the underlined phrase "do her part" in
    Paragraph l?

   C. make her own efforts                  D. be a Red Cross member
26. Where did Moina make her promise?
   A. In Canada.                              B. In Belgium.
   C. At Columbia University.                 D. At University of Georgia.
27. Moina considered the red poppy as         .
   A. the logo of the medical center           B.  the city flower of New York
   C. a memorial flower for soldiers           D. a symbol of University of Georgia
28. John wrote the poem _'          
  A. in hope of a bright future

    From sleeping standing up to shutting down half of their brain, animals have some
strange sleeping habits.
     Now some of these unusual habits, from napping giraffes to birds that sleep while
flying, have been shown in a chart. This chart shows that little brown bats are very
lethargic, sleeping for around 19. 5 hours per day.
     This long period of sleep is thought to be a way of conserving energy and it means
brown bats only hunt for a few hours each night when their insect food is available.
      In contrast, giraffes can go weeks without sleep because these large and slow-moving
animals are constantly easy to the attacks from predators.
   However, other animals are experts at multitasking and can swim or fly while
sleeping. For example, dolphins and whales sleep while keeping half of their brain alert
(警觉), so they don't drown, with dolphins typically napping for around 10 hours a day.
The method is known as "logging" and it has been observed in bottlenose dolphins, which
keep half of their brain at a low level of alertness. This allows the dolphin to keep enough
consciousness to carry on breathing through its blowhole.
   While sea otters aren't alert while they sleep, they form rafts so they are not
separated from each other. The creatures sometimes hold hands or paws when they sleep
and typically eat, sleep and rest while floating in groups of rafts.
29. The underlined word "lethargic" in Paragraph 2 is closest in meaning to _        .
   A. sleepy         B. inactive        C. energetic       D. movable
30. Why do little brown bats have a long period of sleep?
   A. To avoid sunshine.                     B. To save more energy.
   C.  To relax themselves.                       D.  To wait for their insect food.
31. How do dolphins avoid drowning while sleeping?
   A. By taking extra naps.                  B. By holding hands or paws.
   C. By keeping half of their brain alert.       D. By breathing through their blowholes.
32. What do sea otters do in order not to be separated from each other?
   A. They don-t sleep.                      B. They float on rafts.
   C.  They float in groups.                  D. They hold hands all the time.
                                D
     My wife and I, recently driving through Arizona, stopped at a "collector-s shop" in
Tucson, where stones and minerals of many kinds were on display. During the visit, we
were taken into a small room where ordinary-looking rocks were laid out on shelves. Had
I seen them on some hillside, I would not have given them a second thought. Then the
man closed the door so that the room was in total darkness and turned on an ultraviolet(紫
外线的) lamp. Instantly, the rocks leaped into a kind of glory. Brilliant colors of an
indescribable beauty were there before our eyes: a certain power had been switched on.
and a hidden world leaped into life.
      As I look at my universe and walk among my fellow humans, I have the deep belief
that hidden realities are all around us: there in the physical world, and there also in the
human world.                                                          .
      I believe, then, that my chief job in life is to switch on an extra power so that I can
see what my naked eyes, or my naked mind, cannot now see. I believe that I have to do
this particularly with my human fellows, My ordinary eyes tend to stop short at those
envelopes we call human bodies. But we have learned that by turning on a certain power
we can see through to the inside of these envelopes.
     We call this extra power "imagination". At its highest, we call it "empathy", the
power to see through and to feel through to the inner life of other human beings.  When we
turn on this lamp of imaginative sensitivity, we make the ordinary human beings around
us come excitingly alive.
       When we are aware that there are glories of life still hidden from us. we walk humbly
(谎逊地) before the Great Unknown. But we do more than this: we try to increase our
powers of seeing and feeling so that we can turn what is still unknown into what is warmly
and understandingly known. This, I believe, is our great human adventure.
33. Why does the writer mention their visit to the collector's shop?
    A. To introduce the topic.                 B. To share his experience.
    C. To explain his point.                  D. To provide evidence.
34. Which of the following does the writer agree with?
    A. Hidden realities remain in the physical world.
    B. Ordinary minds can never reach others' inside.
    C. He had seen the very rocks on some hillside before.
    D. We should stay humble when we are still unknown.
35. It can be referred to as a great human adventure that _           .
   A. we walk humbly before the Great Unknown
   B. our eyes stop short at ordinary human beings
   C. we try hard to discover the hidden glories of life
   D. we are aware of the truth of hidden realities

    Is "sorry" the hardest word? Not for the British Education Secretary Michael Gove,
    61    has apologized recently to his former French teacher    62    his bad behaviors in
 class. It took him 30 years to express regret. In a letter    63    (publish) in a magazine,
Mr.  Gove says: "It may be too late to say I'm sorry. But, as my mom told me, it's never
 too late to set the record straight.,’
    Researchers argue that people have too high expectations of the power of saying
 sorry.  Some psychologists said in a study that    64    (receive) an apology isn't as    65
(help) as people think. Nevertheless, apologies might be an important. social tool as they
 reaffirm（重新确认）the  66  (exist)of rules that need to be observed.
    The Education Secretary's apology might have been accepted by his old teacher but he
 might get    67    (he) into trouble. According to the Daily Mail, Mr. Gove's mother
didn’t know her son was causing trouble at school and she    68    (say):"He would have
 been punished    6 9    I had known he was being so naughty.” Later, Gove said: ‘‘I can
never express my apology to him face to face these days-it just goes through to his
answering machine.  But when I do    70    (eventual) speak to him, I will tell him a good
sorry，"

    We are now living in a information age, in which TV, cells and the Web are wide
used. It seem that many people cannot enjoy themselves without it. However,  if I
were to give up one of them,1 would turn off TV rather than to switch off my cell or cut
off the Internet.  I could do without TV because few shows took my fancy and there are too
many commercials. Besides, most programs on TV are available elsewhere, either. As for
cells and the Web, they are less necessary for me.  I need a cell to keep in touch my

Writer： Ralph Ellison Novel ： Invisible Man
Invisible Man is Ellison’s best known work, most likely because it was the only novel he ever published during his lifetime and because it won him the National Book Award in 1953. Ellison, originally from Oklahoma worked hard to match his earlier success but felt that he could not make any progress on his next novel that eventually came to include well over 2000 pages. It was not until Ellison’s death that this novel was condensed (浓缩），edited and published under the title Juneteenth.

Margaret Mitchell, born in Georgia, never wanted to seek out literary success and wrote this expansive work in secret, only sending to publishers after she was mocked (讽刺)by a colleague who didn't believe she was capable of writing a novel. She turned out to be more than capable, and the book won a Pulitzer Prize and was adapted into one of the best-known and loved films of all time.

Sewell didn't start off her life intending to be a novelist, she didn't begin writing Black Beauty until she was 51 years old, motivated by the need to create a work that encouraged people to treat horses ( and humans) humanely and it took her six years to complete it.

(CNN) — A 12 -year-old girl who had a feeling that she might be quite clever has taken a test and proved she was absolutely right.
Lydia Sebastian achieved the top score of 162 on Mensa，s Cattell III B paper, suggesting she has a higher IQ than well-known geniuses Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking. The comparison doesn't sit well with the British student, who’s currently in Year 8 at Colchester County high school, a selective girl’s grammar school in Essex, England.
"I don't think I can be compared to such great intellectuals such as Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking. They’ve achieved so much. I don’t think it’s right," Lydia told CNN.
Lydia sat the test in her summer holidays, after raising the idea with her parents and pestering (纠缠）them for the best part of a year. It turns out the test wasn't that hard after all.
"I was really nervous before the test and I thought it was going to be really hard. But as I started the test, I thought it was a bit easier than I thought it was going to be," she said.
Lydia’s  not quite sure what she wants to do when she leaves school, although she’s  leaning toward something "based around Maths, because it’s one of my favorite subjects. " "All I，m going to do is work as hard as I can, and see where that gets me," she said.
To explain Lydia’s  mark’s  level, the top adult score in the Cattell III B test, which primarily tests verbal(语言) reasoning, is 161. A top 2% score 一 which allows entry to Mensa, the club for those with high IQs 一 would be 148 or over. Lydia scored 162, placing her in the top 1% of the population.
24. Lydia wanted to have an IQ test because_,
A. ail people around thought that she was smart 
B. she felt that she might have a high IQ
C. her parents strongly wanted her to do so 
D. the grammar school advised her to do so 
25. What does the underlined words mean in the second paragraph?
A. is not accepted by. 	B. is not related to.
C. does not satisfy. 	D. does not affect.
26. What is Lydia's plan about the future according to the text?
A. She doesn’t have to work hard with her high IQ.
B. She has a tendency to focus around Maths.
C. She is quite sure about what to do in the future.
D. She will drop out of the grammar school.
27. What do we know from the last paragraph?
A. No one has achieved a higher IQ than Lydia,
B. Whoever has a high IQ can enter Mensa. 
C. Only adults with high IQs can enter Mensa.
D. Mensa is a club for those with high IQs at least 148.

The European Union on Monday prohibited the use of X-ray body scanners (扫描仪）in European airports, parting ways with the U. S. Transportation Security Administration, which has used hundreds of the scanners as a way to screen millions of airline passengers for explosives hidden under clothing.
The European Commission, which enforces common policies of the EU’s 27 member countries, adopted the rule "in order not to risk doing harm to citizens' health and safety."
As a ProPublica/PBS NewsHour investigation detailed earlier this month, X-ray body scanners use ionizing radiation (电离辐射)，a form of energy that has been shown to damage DMA and cause cancer. Although the amount of radiation is extremely low, equal to the radiation a person would receive in a few minutes of flying, several research studies have concluded that a small number of cancer cases would result from scanning hundreds of millions of passengers a year.
European countries will be allowed to use an alternative body scanner relying on radio frequency waves, which have not been linked to cancer. The U. S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has also used hundreds of those machines —known as millimeter-wave scanners —in U. S. airports. But unlike Europe, it has decided to use both types of scanners.
The TSA would not comment specifically on the EU 's decision. But in a statement, TSA spokesman Mike McCarthy said, "As one of our many layers of security, TSA uses the most advanced technology available to provide the best opportunity to detect dangerous items, such as explosives.
“ We strictly test our technology to ensure it meets our high detection and safety standards before it is placed in airports," he continued. "Since January 2010, advanced imaging technology has detected more than 300 dangerous or illegal items on passengers in U. S. airports nationwide."
Body scanners have been controversial (有争议的）in the United States since they were first used in prisons in the late 1990s and then in airports for tests after 9/11.
28. Why did the European prohibit the use of X-ray scanners in European airports?
A. Because they are made in the USA. B. Because they are not effective in use.
C- Because they might do harm to passengers. D. Because their radiation is extremely low.
29. Which of the following is true about the new body scanners to be used in Europe?.
A. They will risk doing harm to passengers. B. They use ionizing radiation heavily.
C. Their radiation is extremely high. D. They won't risk causing cancer.
30. What can we infer from TSA’s statement?
A. The TSA will stop using the X-ray scanners. 
B. The TSA won't use EU’s alternative scanners.
C. The EU’s alternative scanners are not advanced.
D. The X-ray scanners are safe and effective.
31. What is the main idea of the passage?
A. EU and the US have a different opinion.
B. Europe Bans X-Ray Body Scanners Used at US Airports.
C. Different scanners will be used in American.
D. Body scanners have been controversial.
D
If drinking coffee or tea has become part of your daily routine, you might wonder what it's doing to your long-term heart health. New research from Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology, a journal (期刊）of the American Heart Association, found that high tea consumption and proper coffee consumption may be associated with decreased rates of death from coronary heart disease ( CHD)(冠心病).
The study followed more than 37,000 tea and coffee drinkers over 13 years. Participants completed food recalls to document their typical intake of tea and coffee, and were divided into groups that ranged from light to heavy consumption. Researchers accounted for variables(变量）such as health histories, height, weight, and waist circumference (腰围）and recorded the number of deaths from cardiovascular (心血管的）disease and stroke during the study period.
Overall results showed that consuming more than six cups of tea per day was associated with a 36% lower risk of death from heart disease compared to consuming less than one cup of tea per day. There appeared to be no such protective effect of tea-drinking at any amount for risk of death from stroke. Among coffee drinkers, more proper consumption levels (2-3 cups per day) were associated with the greatest risk reduction for death from heart disease (21% ) compared to drinking less than one cup of coffee per day.
Researchers acknowledged certain inconclusive variables within their findings. For example, the difference between decaffeinated(去咖啡因的）and regular coffee could not be accurately accounted for, nor could specific recommendations be made for type of tea, though due to its popularity in the Netherlands where the study took place, researchers assumed most tea consumption to be black tea.
Furthermore, researchers found that tea and coffee drinkers had opposite lifestyles, with tea drinkers tending to engage in healthy lifestyle habits and coffee drinkers being more likely to eat less healthy and smoke. It was difficult to say with certainty what impact these other lifestyle variables may have contributed to the overall results.
32. What's the conclusion of the study?
A. People should drink tea and coffee as much as possible.
B. Drinking more tea may benefit people with CHD.
C. High tea consumption may reduce the rate of stroke.
D. Coffee consumption has nothing to do with heart disease. 
33. Which of the following variables haven’t been considered?
A. Health histories. B. Height and weight.
C. Waist circumference. D. The type of tea and coffee.
34. What can be inferred from the last paragraph?
A. All people in the Netherlands like black tea.
B. Tea and coffee drinkers had a similar life style,
C. Other variables have no effect on the results.
D. There are still something uncertain about the study.
35. Which of the following might be the best title?
A. Why our heart loves coffee and tea, B. Drink more tea and coffee.
C. Heart disease will be reduced. D. An amazing findings about heart diseases.

M: It’s proved that ten percent of all the patients with disease get better.
W: What? Only ten percent? Were you trying to cheat me when you told me that I was getting better?

Sometime in October, my teacher told us about the speech contest. The topic was “People who have overcome obstacles in their lives.” I thought my great grandpa, who has had cancer and is still living, would be perfect for it. He has overcome a lot of obstacles in his life. A couple weeks later, the class gave their presentations. My teacher had to pick five students to go on to the next level. I was one of them! Then the top five from each of the three classes competed. The top seven would be the finalists. I was one of them again. The top seven worked really hard. I was the sixth to present. I was soon done. After the seventh person finished, the judges made their final decisions. They announced the winners. The third-place winner was Anna. The second-place winner was Sarah, and the first place winner was Kelli! I had just won first place! That was my once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The students in the audience were clapping and cheering! That was a moment I will always remember!

Choosing what you want to do with the rest of your life can be challenging, here are some suggestions on how to choose a college major that you will enjoy.
Let your core classes help you choose a major
If you are still in high school, take a look at each of your classes and identify which ones you enjoy most. If you’re going back to college after starting your career, think back to your best high school classes (e.g. Math, biology, history, etc.). This can help you identify your strengths and interests so you can narrow your list of possible university degree programs to a particular field of study.
Prioritize(划分优先顺序) your career wants and needs
First and foremost, a college major should be chosen based on your interest and career goals. However, it is not uncommon for students to select their majors based on the careers of their parents or siblings(兄弟姐妹).If following in their footsteps is not right for the student, then it will likely lead to an unfulfilling education and career.
When choosing a major, it is important to identify what aspects of a career are most important to you(money, creative freedom, helping people, working outdoors, etc.) Making a list of your top priorities will shed plenty of light on which degree or major is best for you. Also, talk to your parents and siblings about the choices they made and whether they think those majors and careers would be a good fit for you.
Additional tips for choosing majors
Seeking outside advice, not just from family members, is always recommended when choosing a college major. Talk with career counselors, high school teachers, guidance counselors and students who currently enrolled in a major you are interested in. Speaking to professors at universities or to professionals in the field can also give you a good idea of what you might expect from a career.
There are also tests you can take that give an insight into career matches, dominant personality characters and key interests. While a test should not dictate your choices, it can offer you a new perspective on yourself and open your eyes to majors and career prospects you didn’t consider.
21. Where does the support for your particular field of study mainly come from?
A. The college courses that you enjoy most.
B. Every class in your high school
C. The beginning of your career
D. Your best high school subjects
22. The last two paragraphs are mainly to discuss______________.
A. advice from others and tests 
B. the careers of parents and siblings
C. suggestions from parents
D. professionals’ ideas about majors
23. What would be the best title for the passage?
A. My views on College Education
B. How to choose the Best College Major for you
C. Learning to Challenge Career Goals
D. Offering You a New Perspective on Yourself

                                B 
A little more than 30 years ago, a teenager named Jadav “Molai” Payeng began burying seeds along a barren sandbar(沙洲) near his birthplace in northern India’s Assam. Not long after that, he decided to dedicate his life to this effort, so he moved to the site in order that he could work full-time creating a new forest ecosystem. Unbelievably, the spot today hosts a sprawling(蔓延的) 1360 acres of jungle that Payeng single-handedly planted.
The times of India recently caught up with Payeng in his remote forest cottage to learn more about how he came to leave such an unbelievable mark on the landscape.
It all started way back in 1979, when floods washed a large number of snakes ashore on the sandbar. One day after the floods, Payeng, only 16 then, found the place dotted with the dead snakes. That was the turning point of his life.
“The snakes died in the heat without any tree cover. I sat down and wept over their lifeless bodies. I asked the forest department if they could grow trees there. They said nothing would grow there. Instead, they asked me to try growing bamboo. It was painful, but I did it. There was nobody to help me. Nobody was interested,” says Payeng, now 47.
While it's taken years for Payeng’s remarkable dedication to planting to receive some well-deserved recognition internationally, it didn't take long for wildlife in the region to benefit from the forest. Demonstrating a keen understanding of ecological balance, Payeng even transplanted ants to his ecosystem to maintain its natural harmony. Soon the shadeless sandbar was transformed into a natural ecosystem. The forest, called the Molai woods, now serves as a safe habitat for numerous birds, deer, tigers and eleghants.
Despite Payeng’s outstanding project, forestry officials in the region first learned of this new forest in 2008, and since then they’ve come to recognize his efforts as truly remarkable, but perhaps not enough.
“ We’re amazed at Payeng,” says Gunin Sailia, Assistant Conservator of Forests. “ He has been at it for 30 years. Had he been in any other country, he would have been made a hero.”
24. Payeng moved to the barren sandbar to________________
A. make a living there  B. plant trees to improve the environment
C. do some research    D. look after the 1360 acres’ jungle
25. It can be concluded that the interview in the report above was conducted in _____________
A. 1979     B. 2008    C. 2010     D. 2012  
26. Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage?
A. Payeng got a lot of help from the forest department at the beginning
B. It took quite a long time for Payeng’s dedication to be recognized
C. Payeng earned his fame by transplanting ants to his ecosystem.
D. The Molai woods now is used as a zoo to attract India tourists.
27. The underlined sentence implies that ________________
A. Payeng should be honored as a great hero in India.
B. Payeng has been a great hero in other countries
 C. other countries should not make Payeng a hero
D. India made Payeng a hero earlier than other countries  
C
One retired high school teacher in Canada has a great surprise for his former students that is 20 years in the making.
In 1994, Bruce Farrer’s ninth grade English class at Bert Fox Community High School in Saskatchewan, got a special assignment, reported the National Post. Farrer asked his students to write a 10-page letter to their future selves, which he then promised to mail to them 20 years later.
Farrer kept his promise to those students, as well as other students he taught during his more than 40-year career. “I was trying to think of some assignments that would be special, and it just sort of came up. Well, I would try this assignment,” Farrer said on CBC Morning Edition.
Although Farrer retired in 2002, he took several boxes of the letters from his former students with him, and began the long and difficult process of tracking them down and mailing the letters.
One former student, Scott Fulton, became a teacher himself and even taught for a while at the high school he went to as a teenager, according to CBC News. He got his letter last week. “I was just feeling honored and grateful,” Fulton said after receiving the handwritten letter.
Another former student, DJ Anardi, got the letter from his past self about a month ago. It read “Hey, you good-looking guy, how is your life?” according to the National Post. Anardi’s letter said that he had a crush on the woman at the time who is now his wife.
“I think our society now is a society of non-commitment,” Farrer said. “We say we’re going to do something, whether it’s in a marriage, or with our kids or maybe even with our organizations we join… I think it’s important to have a sense of commitment, and maybe in a minor way, the kids see I value that.”
28. Farrer promised his students that he would _____________.
  A. grade the assignments carefully
  B. write back to them sooner or later
  C. send their letters back in the future
  D. keep in touch with them all the time
29. According to CBC News, Scott Fulton ______________.
  A. did well in his lessons at school
  B. often wrote to other classmates
  C. was very happy to work with Farrer
  D. used to be a teacher in his mother school
30. The underlined phrase “had a crush on” (in Paragraph 6) probably means __________.
  A. fell in love with     B. took the place of 
  C. caught up with      D. broke away from
31. If you make a commitment, you should ___________________.
   A. help others often       B. keep your promise
   C. join an organization     D. make your kids satisfied

D
As I enter my 40s, I’ve noticed many of my parents’ generation think social networking is something they are simply incapable of understanding. They fear that, should they try, they would somehow get it wrong; they would say the wrong thing, do the wrong thing or behave in a way that causes embarrassment. But here's the first secret of social media: Everyone feels this way.
I recently met a young actress who complained that her work demands that she join microblog, but she always feels like she doesn’t have anything smart to say. It’s the same resistance I hear from the older generation, who, however, have somehow convinced themselves that age is the barrier, rather than the differences of individual taste.
Here’s the second secret of social media: everybody uses it for more or less the same reasons. The older generation often sign up to stay in touch with children and relatives. We consider this kind of contact as an old-fashioned activity, but it is exactly why younger people use social media. The truth is most people use social media to gently keep an eye on one another, to see how those they care about are doing without needing to ring them up on the phone every night.
And this is the last secret of social media: everyone gets to use it their own way. Newcomers---the younger and the older--- who worry about “getting it right” are assuming that there’s a right way to get it. But actually there isn’t. Personally, I talk a lot on microblog. And some people post nothing and they use social media every day as readers. Social media companies would rather see people filling their networks up with pictures and posts, but there’s no rule against being a fly on the wall. It’s also a fine way to engage.
We’re quick to forget that the web wasn’t invented by 13-year-olds; it was created by today’s seniors. I’d never try forcing those with no interest on social networks to use microblog. But don’t let the talk of age divides put you off. There’s nothing to stop the older generation from retaking the network their own generation created.
32. What’s the author’s purpose of writing this passage?
  A. To share with us his personal experience of using social media.
  B. To tell us a few secrets of social media that he discovered.
  C. To explain why the old generation don’t use social media.
  D. To relieve the old generation from fearing using social media.
33. The underlined words “a fly on the wall” in the 4th paragraph refer to ______________.
  A. a person who promotes reading online books
  B. a person who only watches others’ posts quietly
  C. a person who causes trouble to others
  D. a person who posts many pictures
34. According to the author, which is a reason for old people’s fear of using social media?
  A. They believe that they may fall into embarrassing situations.
  B. They prefer to stay in touch with relatives in real life.
  C. They have no interest in social networking.
  D. They have no idea what to post online.
35. Which of the following may best describe the structure of the passage?
A.   ①           B. ①② ③ ④     C. ① ② ③ ④   D. ①②  ③④  
     ↙↓↘               ↘↓↙           ↘↓↙↙          ↘ ↙

  During the last summer holiday, my parents and I paid visit to my grandparents by train. There was a large number of people and the train was crowded, but everyone helped those who had lots of baggages and behaved politely. Along the way, we enjoyed beautifully views. At first, we saw one hill after another. Then which came into view were fields with green crops. In a six-hour trip, we arrived at my grandparents’ house. Exhausted though I felt, but I was happy to see my grandparents，whom I haven’t seen for a long time. It’s really an excited trip because it was the first time that I had taken so a long-distance train.

                                           A
Lots of people buy books and products from Amazon, an online seller. They order and pay over the Internet and the books are shipped through the mail or a delivery service like FedEx.
One day, people could get their Amazon deliveries from an “unmanned aerial vehicle” — a tiny flying vehicle that looks like a toy helicopter. And instead of waiting days to get the parcel, it could be at the buyer’s home in half an hour or less. The company is working on a fleet of tiny vehicles they call “Prime Air”. The vehicles are also known as “octocopters”. On their website, Amazon says, “one day, Prime Air vehicles will be as normal as seeing mail trucks on the road today.”
The U.S.’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is working on safety regulations for unmanned flying vehicles like the Prime Air copters(飞机). Those regulations will make sure the copters are able to fly safely where they need to go. Once the FAA has put its rules in place, which could be as early as 2015, Amazon will be ready with its fleet of tiny flyers. The process could take as many as five years.
The new delivery service would likely be available only in the United States at first. The copters the company is testing now can handle packages up to five pounds (2.3 kg) and they have a range of 10 miles (16 kilometres).
Other companies are also looking at using unmanned flying vehicles to deliver their products. For instance, Domino’s Pizza in the UK released a video showing a “DomiCopter,” delivering a pizza. That video may have been a publicity stunt(噱头). In any case, just like Prime Air’s octocopters, the DomiCopters don’t have clearance to take off just yet.
21. For what purpose does Amazon want to use the Prime Air?
  A. To remind people to order online.			
B. To check the delivery service.
  C. To shorten the delivery period.			
D. To predict the sales volumes.
22. What does Paragraph Four mainly tell us about the new delivery method?
  A. Its safety.  							
B. Its appearance.
  C. Its moving speed.  						
D. Its delivery ability.
23. What can be concluded from the last paragraph?
  A. The delivery service in the world is making great progress.
  B. The new vehicles would be put into immediate production.
  C. The designer will promote his new product to other countries.
  D. The similar delivery vehicles in other places worked out to be well.
                                        B
When Luke went to university he thought he would be starting a new journey in life and getting his own place. In the UK, it’s common to fly the nest at a fairly young age. Many choose a flatshare; others make plans to get on the property ladder.
But the current economic situation forced Luke back to his mum’s house at the age of 27. And he’s not alone: a quarter of young adults in the UK now live with their parents. The Office for National Statistics said more than 3.3 million adults between the ages of 20 and 34 were living with their parents in 2013.
Lack of jobs and the high cost of renting accommodation made Luke change his plans. He’s frustrated: “There’s something very difficult about being an adult living in an environment where you’re still a child,” he says. “It limits me socially; sometimes I feel it limits me professionally.”
Indeed, many young people have no choice but to stay at ‘the hotel of Mum and Dad’.
	Krissy had to return home after a year away and now lives in rather cramped conditions, sharing the family’s three-bedroom house with her siblings. She says they end up getting on each other’s nerves when it’s time to use the bathroom in the morning.
Of course, residing with your parents is not unusual in some countries. Economic conditions, culture, or family traditions mean many young people stay at home until they get married. Even then, it can be too expensive to rent or buy a house and the married couple continue to live at one of their parents’ homes.
But some parents seem to enjoy having their kids back at home. Janice’s daughters are part of what’s being called ‘the boomerang generation’. She says: “I get to share their lives with them, and I’ve got to know them all as adults. We have the sort of conversations that good friends do.” So for some it’s a win-win situation — spending time with your families, and saving money.
24. How is the passage developed?
  A. By listing figures. 				
B. By offering examples.
  C. By analyzing causes.  			
D. By making comparisons.
25. We can learn from the passage that________.
A. All the parents enjoy living with their children 
B. Living with parents is common in some countries
C. The author approves of children’s living with parents
D. Janice belongs to a group called “the boomerang generation”
26. What does the underlined sentence mean in the fifth paragraph?
A. They shout at each other angrily.
B. They get on very well with each other.
C. They finally make each other annoyed.
D. They are unwilling to sharing with each other.
27. What is the purpose of the passage?
A. To persuade children into living on their own after getting married.
B. To show the present situation of young people living with their parents.
C. To compare the advantages and disadvantages of living with parents.
D. To solve the problems young adults may face after going to university.
                                   C
Don’t we all know a “Happy Meal” when we see one—the famous boxed meal that includes a hamburger, a kid—sized portion of fries, a drink and so on, served with a toy that’s extremely popular with children who love to collect them?
But collectors of these little toys will soon be in for a surprise. For the book lovers though, there is some good news. McDonalds will replace toys with books. However, each of these books will mainly pass on nutritional messages.
Do you know that McDonalds has been marketing the boxed kid’s meal since 1979? Happy Meals are extremely popular with kids, especially for its collectible toys, when you consider that over 1.3 billion of these packages are sold each year! These packages have been very controversial. Health supporters believe that drawing kids to these meals with toys is a clever way of promoting unhealthy food choices. They see it as an advertising strategy of “catching its customers young”—a move that has paid off very well for the fast food company.
Child development experts say that food habits get formed in children by age six and continue through to their adult life. Fatty and sugary foods such as those served in McDonalds’ Happy Meals are believed to play a big role in growing health problems such as obesity and diabetes. Public health care costs have gone up and untold amounts of other health problems. In 2010, the State of California tried to ban toys in Happy Meals. But it was strongly opposed by some as being heavy-handed, and the ban was thrown out by the government.	
While some people believe that McDonalds, with its large following of children, can create a powerful message through the books, others believe its actions are contradictory. Anyway, the company is trying to spread the message of nutrition while it is serving food that is anything but healthy.
28. What’s the aim of the question raised in the first paragraph?
A. To give a surprise to the book lovers.
B. To persuade the readers to buy boxed meals.
C. To make the readers think about the answer.
D. To get the readers’ attention to the passage.
29. Books will be added into Happy Meals to______.
  A. encourage more kids to read books
  B. introduce the history of McDonald’s
  C. have kids learn more about nutrition
  D. help young kids learn to read and write
30. In the author’s opinion, Happy Meals______.
  A. bring much fun to children
  B. do no actual good to children’s health
  C. are popular with the young and the old
  D. teach children a lot about nutrition
31. Which of the following can be the best title for the passage?
A. Are Happy Meals Really Happy?
B. The links Between Food and Health
C. The Importance of Eating Healthy Food
D. Happy Meal—A New Advertising Method                                        
                                          D
Parents who exert too much control over their children could be causing them lifelong psychological damage, according to a study which tracked a group of people born in the 1940s until the present day.
Researchers found that people who reported that parents had intruded on their privacy in childhood or encouraged dependence were more likely to have low scores in surveys of happiness and general wellbeing carried out in their teens, their 30s, their 40s and even their 60s.
The negative impact on wellbeing was comparable in degree to that observed in people who have lost a family member, experts from University College London (UCL) said.
In contrast, people who said their parents were more caring, warm and responsive to their needs tended to be more content well into adulthood.
The findings are the culmination of a survey which has tracked more than 5,000 people since their birth in 1946. It is well-established that childhood influences can have profound effect on the 
developing brain, but this is one of the first studies that have attempted to measure their impact over
such a long period of time.
Information on parenting styles was only available from the study participants themselves, who were asked to recall  their childhoods when in their 40s, and may therefore suffer from a degree  of so-called recall bias – unhappy people may be more likely to depict their parents as controlling. 
However, the research said the findings agreed with previous studies which have shown that children who are  able to form secure emotional bonds with parents are more likely to have secure happy relationships later in life.
“parents also give us stable base from which to explore the world while warmth and responsiveness has been shown to promote social and emotional development,” said Dr. Maid Stafford, of the Medical Research Council’s(MRC) Lifelong and Ageing unit at UCL.
“By contrast, psychological control can limit a child’s independence and leave them less able to regulate  their own behaviour.” Dr Stafford said that the study did not seek to blame parents.
“Parents are vitally important to the mental wellbeing of future generations,” she said. 
“Policies to reduce economic and other pressures on parents could help them to foster better relationships with their children.”
	Previous research has shown a clear link between economic stress in parents and poorer early child development.
32. What can be inferred from the passage?
   A. Various parenting styles can count.
   B. An unfair finding can easily mislead parents.
   C. There is a side effect from too much control over children.
   D. There is a link between parents’ economy and child development.
33. According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE?
   A. Children should say no to parents’ control.
   B. Physical control can limit a child’s independence.
   C. Parents’ control over children is completely wrong.
   D. People of many age ranges are interviewed in the survey.
34. The study, according to Dr Stafford, is intended to______.
   A. blame parents with control over children
   B. encourage the children’s dependence
   C. point out the necessity of parenting
   D. build up proper parenting styles
35. The underlined word “culmination” in Paragraph Five probably means______.
   A. result				              B. effect				
C. prediction				          D. warning

Why Do Autumn Leaves Change Color?
We all enjoy the colors of autumn leaves.   36    To answer this questions, we first have to understand what leaves are and what they do.
Leaves are nature’s food factories. Plants take water from the ground through their roots and take carbon dioxide from the air.   37   Plants use the sugar as food for energy and as a building block for growing. The way plants turn water and carbon dioxide into sugar is called photosynthesis(光合作用). Chlorophyll (叶绿素）helps make photosynthesis happen. Chlorophyll is what gives plants their green color. 
As summer ends and autumn comes, the days get shorter and shorter.    38   
During winter, there is not enough light or water for photosynthesis. The trees will rest and begin to shut down their food-making factories. The green chlorophyll disappears from the leaves. As the bright green fades away, we begin to see yellow and orange colors.    39    We just can’t see them in the summer, because they are covered up by the green chlorophyll.
The bright reds and purples we see in leaves are made mostly in Autumn. In some trees, like maples, glucose(糖份) is trapped in the leaves after photosynthesis stops.   40    The brown color of trees like oaks is made from wastes left in the leaves.
    All these things make the beautiful colors we enjoy in Autumn.
A. Yellow and orange colors attract many of us in Autumn.
B. This is how the trees “know” to begin getting ready for winter.
C. Have you ever wondered how and why a fall leaf changes color? 
D. Small amounts of these colors have been in the leaves all along. 
E. For what reason do people prefer autumn leaves to summer leaves?
F. Sunlight and the cool nights of autumn make the leaves a red color. 
G. Plants use sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide into a kind of sugar.

Remembering My Father’s Vest
People get into trouble because they don’t know enough to keep cool. As a child, I had a lot of 
  41  that had been held back and not released. Worse still, I was not good at  42  constructively.
Once as I was getting ready for school, my mother  43  handed me my father’s vest instead of mine. This was around the time when I was going to be larger in  44  than my father, so as I put on the vest, I felt like I was being choked in it! I   45   that it was a small oversight(疏忽) on my mother’s part, but  46  the feeling of being choked drowned me and I got very angry.
I took my anger out on my mother  47   thinking much. I was so upset when she had handed me the wrong vest, and I  48  by violently tearing it apart from my chest!

W: Hi, Mr. Lee, I am a reporter from the New York Times. It will be great if you can tell me some information about chopsticks, such as their origin and the materials they are made from.
M: Good question. Chopsticks originated in China, but they are widely used in many Asian countries. Chopsticks may be made of any of the following materials: bamboo, wood, gold, silver, ivory, or plastic, and they may be either round or square. Some chopsticks are decorated with colored pictures. Ordinary chopsticks used in Chinese homes are made of wood or bamboo. In ancient times, the rich used jade or gold chopsticks to display their wealth. Many kings and emperors used silver chopsticks to see if their food had been poisoned.
W: OK, thank you. And I’d like to know why Chinese people use chopsticks. Why not knives and forks, like Americans?
M: Oh, that is a good question. I think Chinese people choose chopsticks, rather than knives and forks, because Chinese people, under the influence of Confucianism, have traditionally considered knives and forks as symbolizing a type of violence. On the other hand, chopsticks reflect gentleness and kindness. And maybe Chinese food simply seems to taste better when eaten with chopsticks.

第二节 书面表达（满分25分）
Dear students,
    I am glad to be here to share my idea about what you should learn. From my point of view, how to be a man is first required. We had better grow up to learn to be honest and kind. It is highly recommended that we should spend more time in helping and cooperating with others. In that way, we can learn how to get along well with others and know who we are, what we should do and what we’d better not.
The second required is to study. Learning how to learn and developing the good habit of learning are the two vital parts in the process of study. For instance, we are supposed to preview before class, pay close attention to what our teacher are saying, and review the knowledge we have gained. Only in this way can we form the good habit of learning.
    Besides, It is advisable for us to learn how to live independently and how to deal with the difficulties properly in daily life. Learn to wash our clothes, clean rooms, cook, etc.
That’s what I’d like to say. What’s your opinions?
Thanks for your attention.

I recently traveled to San Francisco for some meetings and found myself with a half day to  36  . My   37  : The 49ers’ first game of the season, against the Green Bay Packers. The America’s Cup sailing races. Or I could get   38  . 
After a terribly long line at the car rental center, I was   39  . So I disappeared into the fog and clouds shrouding the Pacific Coast Highway and headed south with absolutely no   40   in mind. I drove through tunnels   41   out of the mountains and stopped at a few state beaches; at one, I watched a wedding out on the cliffs among the crashing   42  . Back in the car, I drove toward San Gregorio, a town that you can easily   43  . I know because I drove right through it and   44   up on a narrow pine tree–bordered asphalt(柏油) road that felt like it would go on   45  . 
A few people just moved around outside the San Gregorio General Store, talking about the motorcycles they've owned over the years. Inside, I found a bar with regular customers, two people playing guitar together, and, of course, a full-on store. I   46   a song, took a seat quickly, and watched the guitarists play and dance. Then I congratulated them,   47   a couple of wrinkled dollars in their bucket, and walked back out into the world. 
It was pouring outside. We all waited, some patiently, others   48  , because nature messed up their hurried day. I got lost in the sound and sight of the heavens   49   away the dirt and dust of the world. “Mom, let’s run through the   50  .” said a girl. “When you were talking to Daddy about his cancer, you said, if God can get us through this, he can get us through anything!” “Honey, you are   51   right.” Mom said. Then off they ran. And yes, I did. I ran. 
The day could have been so   52  : being   53   into a stadium or bar half-watching sports.  54   this was much more rewarding. Hours prior, I was on a flight with the masses, going through the motions. Then I was out on my own, having an unexpected and unrepeatable experience. 
    I learned something on September 8: Don’t be   55   to get lost—on purpose or otherwise—and have zero expectations. It will be good for you. I promise.

第三部分 阅读理解(共15小题；每小题2分，满分30分)
请认真阅读下列短文，从短文后各题所给的A、B、C、D四个选项中，选出最佳选项，并在答题卡上将该项涂黑。
A
A classic joke goes like this: A nurse rushes into an exam room and says, “Doctor, doctor, there’s an invisible man in the waiting room.” The doctor says, “Tell him I can’t see him.”
Pretty simple, right? 
Here’s how I tell it: “A nurse—her name is Joyce—feels a presence in the waiting room. She looks around but sees nothing. She jumps up from her desk, carefully replaces her chair, and runs down the lavender-hued hallway to the doctor’s office. She knocks on the door. No response. He’s not there. Where can he be? She continues down the hall, admiring a lithograph of an 18th-century Mississippi paddleboat along the way.” By this time, my audience has left, but I soldier on. “She bursts into the exam room and says, ‘Doctor, doctor!’ The doctor, I should mention, is a urologist with a degree from Ohio State, which is where my nephew …” 
You get the idea. I’m an embellisher. I can’t leave a simple gag alone. 
　　I’m not the only joke-challenged member of the family. My sister’s worse than I am. Her problem: She can’t remember them. “‘A nurse rushes into an exam room and says…’Uh, let me start all over again. ‘A nurse rushes into a waiting…’No, it’s not the waiting room. She just came from the waiting room. Let me start all over again. ‘A doctor rushes into…’ No, wait…” 
　　My uncle’s different. He’s guilty of taking a perfectly fine joke and selling it as the second coming of Oscar Wilde,“Okay, this is a good one. Ready? No, really, ready? Okay, fasten your seat belts. Ready?‘A nurse…’Got it? A nurse? Okay, ready?‘A nurse rushes into an exam room and says, “Doctor, doctor, there’s an invisible man in the waiting room.”’ Now, this is where it gets funny. Ready?” 
　　No one is ever ready, so they leave before he gets to the punch line. 
My father’s on Wall Street, so he hears all the jokes before they hit the Web. And he lets you know he knows them all by telling you all of them. He also knows that most people don’t like jokes. So he slips them in under the radar: “I was chatting with Ben Bernanke the other day. You know Ben, don’t you? The Fed chief? Anyway, we were reviewing the Fed’s policy on long-term interest rates, and he told me it had evolved into its current iteration only after a nurse rushed into an exam room and said, ‘Doctor, doctor, there’s…’ Hey, where are you going?”
My brother Mark understands that the secret to good joke telling is to know your audience. When he entertained my grandmother’s bridge club one evening, he made it a point to adapt the joke to them: “A beautiful blonde nurse rushes into a consulting room…” 
　　No one in my family has ever finished this joke. 
But as bad as it is not to be able to tell a joke, there’s something worse: not being able to listen to one. Take my cousin Mitch for example. 
“Why couldn’t the doctor see him?” he asked. 
“Because he’s invisible,” I said. 
“Now, I didn’t get that. I thought the doctor couldn’t see him because he was with a patient.” 
　 “Well, yeah, okay, but the fact that the guy was invisible…” 
　 “Could the nurse see him?” 
　 “No. She’s the one who said he was invisible…” 
　 “How’d she know he was there?”
　 “Because he…” 
“When you say he was invisible, does that mean his clothes were invisible too?” Here’s where I tried to walk away. 
　 “Because if his clothes weren’t invisible,” Mitch said, stepping between me and the exit, “then the doctor could see him, right?” 
“Yeah, but …” 
　 “At least his clothes.” 
“I guess…” 
“Unless he was naked.” 
“Okay, he was naked!” 
“Why would he go to his doctor naked?” 
Next time you see my family and someone is telling a joke, do yourself a favor: Make yourself invisible. 
56. Which of the following is true according to this article?
A. No one in the writer’s family is good at telling jokes.    
B. Mark is the best at telling jokes in his family.
C. Mitch is very sensitive to all kinds of jokes.           
D. A typically classic joke should cover all the details.
57. What is inappropriate about Mark’s adaptation of the joke?
A. He knows the audience very well.    B. He shouldn’t have entertained a bridge club.
C. He shouldn’t have begun the story with a beautiful blond nurse.      
D. He shouldn’t have told old people jokes.
58. Mitch stepped between me and the exit because __________.
A. he wanted to go out with me       
B. he wanted to block my way out
C. he was trying to repay the situation in the consulting room
D. he wanted to show that the doctor could see the patient
59. Which is the best title of the passage?
A. Learn to Amuse Others               	B. Where to Find a Doctor
C. How to Ruin a Classic Joke             	D. A Story about a Funny Family　
B
On his bench in Madison Square Soapy moved uneasily, and he realized the fact that the time had come for him to provide against the coming winter.
The winter ambitions of Soapy were not of the highest. In them there were no dreams of Mediterranean voyages or blue Southern skies. Three months on the Island was what his soul desired. Three months of assured board and bed and good company, safe from north winds seemed to Soapy the most desirable thing.
Just as the more fortunate New Yorkers had bought their tickets to Palm Beach each winter, Soapy had made his arrangements for his annual journey to the Island. And now the time had come. 
There were many institutions of charity in New York where he might receive lodging and food, but to Soapy’s proud spirit the gifts of charity were undesirable. You must pay in humiliation of spirit for everything received at the hands of mercy. So it was better to be a guest of the law. 
Soapy, having decided to go to the Island, at once set about accomplishing his desire. He left his bench and went up Broadway. He stopped at the door of a glittering cafe. He was shaven and his coat was decent. If he could reach a table in the restaurant, the portion of him that would show above the table would raise no doubt in the waiter’s mind. A roasted duck, with a bottle of wine, a cigar and a cup of coffee would be enough. Such a dinner would make him happy, for the journey to his winter refuge.
But as Soapy entered the restaurant door, the head waiter’s eye fell upon his shabby trousers and old shoes. Strong hands pushed him in silence and haste out into the street.
Some other way of entering the desirable refuge must be found.
At a corner of Sixth Avenue Soapy took a stone and sent it through the glass of a glittering shop window. People came running around the corner, a policeman at the head of them. Soapy stood still, with his hands in his pockets, and smiled at the sight of the policeman.
“Where is the man that has done that?” asked the policeman.
“Don’t you think that I have had something to do with it?” said Soapy, friendly.
The policeman paid no attention to Soapy. Men who break windows don’t remain to speak with policemen. They run away. He saw a man running and rushed after him, stick in hand. Soapy, disgusted, walked along, twice unsuccessful.
On the opposite side of the street was a restaurant for people with large appetites and modest purses. Soapy entered this place without difficulty. He sat at a table and ate beefsteak and pie. And then he told the waiter he had no money.
“Go and call a cop,” said Soapy. “And don’t keep a gentleman waiting.”
“No cop for you,” said the waiter. “Hey!”
Then Soapy found himself lying upon his left ear on the pavement. He arose with difficulty, and beat the dust from his clothes. Arrest seemed a rosy dream. The Island seemed far away. 
After another unsuccessful attempt to be arrested for harassing a young woman, Soapy went further toward the district of theatres. 
When he saw a policeman standing in front of a glittering theatre, he thought of “disorderly conduct”. On the sidewalk Soapy began to sing drunken songs at the top of his voice. He danced, cried, and otherwise disturbed the peace. 
The policeman turned his back to Soapy, and said to a citizen, “It is one of the Yale boys celebrating their football victory. Noisy, but no harm.”
Sadly, Soapy stopped his useless singing and dancing. The Island seemed unattainable. He buttoned his thin coat against the north wind.
In a cigar store he saw a well-dressed man who had set his silk umbrella by the door. Soapy entered the store, took the umbrella, and went out with it slowly. The man with the cigar followed hastily.
“My umbrella,” he said.
“Oh, is it?” said Soapy. “Well, why don’t you call a policeman? I took your umbrella! Why don’t you call a cop? There stands one on the corner.”
The umbrella owner slowed his steps. Soapy did likewise. The policeman looked at them curiously.
“Of course,” said the umbrella man, “well, you know how these mistakes occur…if it’s your umbrella I hope you’ll excuse me – I picked it up this morning in a restaurant – if it’s yours, I hope you’ll…”
“Of course it’s mine,” said Soapy.
The ex-umbrella man retreated. The policeman hurried to help a well-dressed woman across the street.
Soapy threw the umbrella angrily. He was angry with the men who wear helmets and carry clubs. They seemed to regard him as a king who could do no wrong.
At last Soapy stopped before an old church on a quiet corner. Through one window a soft light glowed, where, the organist played a Sunday anthem. For there came to Soapy’s ears sweet music that caught and held him at the iron fence.
The moon was shining; cars and pedestrians were few; birds twittered sleepily under the roof. And the anthem that the organist played cemented Soapy to the iron fence, for he had known it well in the days when his life contained such things as mothers and roses and ambitions and friends.
The influence of the music and the old church produced a sudden and wonderful change in Soapy’s soul. He thought of his degraded days, dead hopes and wrecked faculties.
And also in a moment a strong impulse moved him to battle with his desperate fate. He would pull himself out of this pit; he would make a man of himself again. Those sweet notes had set up a revolution in him. Tomorrow he would be somebody in the world. He would…
Soapy felt a hand on his arm. He looked quickly around into the broad face of a policeman.
“What are you doing here?”
“Nothing.”
“Then come along,” said the policeman.
“Three months on the Island,” said the Judge the next morning.
60. Which of the following is the reason for Soapy’s not turning to charity?
A. His pride gets in the way.   
B. What the institutions of charity offer isn’t what Soapy needs.
C. He wants to be a citizen who obeys the law.
D. The institutions of charity are not located on the island.
61. From the passage, we can see what the two restaurants have in common is that __________.
A. they are both fancy upper class restaurants      B. neither of them served Soapy
C. they both drove Soapy out of the restaurant after he finished his meal   
D. neither of them called cops
62. Hearing the Sunday anthem at the church, Soapy was reminded of __________.
A. his good old days and wanted to play the anthem again
B. his unaccomplished ambition and was determined to get to the Island
C. his disgraceful past and determined to transform himself
D. his rosy dream and wished to realize it
63. By ending the story this way, the author means to __________.
A. show that one always gets what he/she wants with enough efforts
B. make a contrast and criticize the sick society
C. surprise readers by proving justice was done after all
D. put a tragic end to Soapy’s life and show his sympathy for Soapy

C
My heart sank when the man at the immigration counter gestured to the back room. I was born and raised in America, and this was Miami, where I live, but they weren’t quite ready to let me in yet.
　　“Please wait in here, Ms Abujaber,” the immigration officer said. My husband, with his very American last name, accompanied me. He was getting used to this. The same thing had happened recently in Canada when I’d flown to Montreal to speak at a book event. That time they held me for 45 minutes. Today we were returning from a literary festival in Jamaica, and I was startled that I was being sent “in back” once again.
　　The officer behind the counter called me up and said, “Miss, your name looks like the name of someone who’s on our wanted list. We’re going to have to check you out with Washington.”
　　“How long will it take?”
　　“Hard to say ... a few minutes,” he said. “We’ll call you when we’re ready for you.” After an hour, Washington still hadn’t decided anything about me. “Isn’t this computerized?”
　　I asked at the counter. “Can’t you just look me up?”
　　Just a few more minutes, they assured me.
　　After an hour and a half, I pulled my cell phone out to call the friends I was supposed to meet that evening. An officer rushed over. “No phones!” he said. “For all we know you could be calling a terrorist cell and giving them information.”
　　“I’m just a university professor,” I said. My voice came out in a squeak.
　　“Of course you are. And we take people like you out of here in leg irons every day.”
　　I put my phone away.
　　My husband and I were getting hungry and tired. Whole families had been brought into the waiting room, and the place was packed with excitable children, exhausted parents, even a flight attendant.
　　I wanted to scream, to jump on a chair and shout: “I’m an American citizen; a novelist; I probably teach English literature to your children.” Or would that all be counted against me?
　　After two hours in detention, I was approached by one of the officers. “You’re free to go,” he said. No explanation or apologies. For a moment, neither of us moved, we were still in shock.
　　Then we leaped to our feet.
　　“Oh, one more thing.” He handed me a tattered photocopy with an address on it. “If you weren’t happy with your treatment, you can write to this agency.”
　　“Will they respond?” I asked.
　　“I don’t know --- I don’t know of anyone who’s ever written to them before.” Then he added, “By the way, this will probably keep happening each time you travel internationally.”
　　“What can I do to keep it from happening again?”
　　He smiled the empty smile we’d seen all day. “Absolutely nothing.”
　　After telling several friends about our ordeal, probably the most frequent advice I’ve heard in response is to change my name. Twenty years ago, my own graduate school writing professor advised me to write under a pen name so that publishers wouldn’t stick me in what he called “the ethnic ghetto” --- a separate, secondary shelf in the bookstore. But a name is an integral part of anyone’s personal and professional identity -just like the town you’re born in and the place where you’re raised.
　　Like my father, I’ll keep the name, but my airport experience has given me a whole new perspective on what diversity and tolerance are supposed to mean. I had no idea that being an American would ever be this hard.
64. The author was held at the airport because __________.
　 A. she and her husband returned from Jamaica.	B. her name was similar to a terrorist’s.
　 C. she had been held in Montreal.				D. she had spoken at a book event.
65. We learn from the passage that the author would __________ to prevent similar experience from happening again.
A. write to the agency        				B. change her name   
C. avoid traveling abroad        				D. do nothing
66. Her experiences indicate that there still exists __________ in the US.
　 A. hatred			B. discrimination			C. tolerance			D. diversity
67. The author sounds __________ in the last paragraph.
A. impatient		B. bitter					C. worried			D. ironic
D
The malls were filled with people seeking gifts for their loved ones. Some of the malls remained open around the clock, partly to satisfy our needs to buy gifts.  
Behind the materialistic aspect of shopping for gifts lies the idea of caring, being attentive to the desires of special people in our lives. However, to use a well-worn play on words: it is our presence, not our presents, that truly counts. Many of us, unfortunately, can be so inattentive, even in the presence of our loved ones, that we might as well not be there at all.  
Attention is one of the greatest gifts we can give each other. Companies around the globe spend billions every year on advertising to catch our attention for just a short moment at a time. Whole industries — media, entertainment, education — rely on the precious gift of our attention for their continued existence. A baby lacking attention for a long time is likely to be psychologically unhealthy.  
In earlier times, both diet and attention could be left unregulated (没人管的) without major cause for concern. There were natural checks and balances: limited availability of food meant few got fat, for example. Similarly, in bygone times we might have spent a few hours communicating with the village storyteller; today, watching an entire TV series, while speaking to nobody, is common. In traditional societies, with smaller population, everyone would get a fair deal of attention. On many issues we might go to see Grandma or Grandpa; now we have Google and Wikipedia.  
“She just wants attention.” people tend to think little of those doing things simply for attention. But the truth is that human beings need attention, and giving attention to each other is, to a large extent, what human civilization is based upon. This perhaps explains the runaway success of social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook. While we use such sites for “micro Hogging”, “idea voicing” and “status updates” — the reality is that we are often doing no more or less than fulfilling our basic human drive for attention exchange.  
I friend you, you friend me, I retweet you, you retweet me. The charming ease with which we can now get and give attention is why many people appear overly attached to their smartphones. It is also a vicious (恶性的) circle. As ever more people are busy exchanging attention online, there is increasingly less attention to be paid in the real world, which forces more people to seek their attention exchange online, or else risk attention-starvation.  
The very nature of attention exchange is being rapidly transformed, and there is a danger that some of us will develop unhealthy practices. Just as eating red meat every day is a bad idea, so it is with too much attention exchange. The biological consequences of our technological advancement in food production are highly visible; heart disease, diabetes and obesity. The consequences of our transformed attention exchanges will be psychological and social, and so may take longer to identify, but they will be equally damaging.  
Face-to-face attention is becoming rarer, and therefore more valuable. In a sense it is priceless. And it is a gift that can be given all-year-round.  
68. In the first two paragraphs the author __________.  
A. offers advice to attention givers            B. analyses the present problems  
C. states the necessity of presents             D. puts forward his point of view  
69. What can we infer from Paragraphs 6-7?  
A. More people will risk attention-starvation in future.  
B. The nature of attention exchange is rarely changed.  
C. Technological advancement contributes to all diseases. 
D. Transformed attention exchanges do harm to society.                                             
70. The writer’s purpose for writing the passage is to __________.  
A. advocate more focus on real life attention      
B. analyze the necessity of attention giving  
C. give practical tips on attention exchange       
D. recommend some social networking sites

Socrates-an ancient Greek philosopher  
Socrates was an ancient Greek philosopher, who helped to shape Greek beliefs. The ideas he created are present in our culture today.  
  Socrates was a person full of curiosity. From the time he was a young man, Socrates searched for wisdom and truth. He gained wisdom by asking questions. Many people in Athens thought that they had answers. Socrates asked them questions and argued with them about different topics. He did not think they had the knowledge they claimed to have.  
Socrates challenged false ideas people had about things like justice, love, or courage. He would break down the ideas people held．Then he built new and more accurate ideas. Socrates felt that this was what philosophy was all about. Since then, many great philosophers have used this method to find truth．
Throughout his life, Socrates showed no interest in money. He was also not interested in material items. Socrates would allow groups of men to listen to him speak. And he would never take money from them. He always wore the same clothes whatever the season. Socrates argued that his life was better because he had no material wealth. He felt he enjoyed his food more. he said he was stronger and healthier because he was not affected by the weather. He believed happiness came not from having more but from wanting less. 
By the end of the fifth century B.C Athens was not a great city anymore. Politicians betrayed Athens. Socrates had made many people angry over the years. He had always expressed his opinions when he thought laws and policies were wrong. Athens had a new group of political leaders in power, who didn't want to hear Socrates‟comments” about them. They thought Socrates had a bad influence on the young people of Athens. Socrates was also accused of not worshipping the right gods. Charges were brought against Socrates．The politicians wanted to condemn Socrates to death. Socrates’ friends told him to leave Athens. They thought this was the only way for him to save his life. Socrates refused. He did not behave as most people in his situation would．
Socrates said that he had always lived by the rules of Athens and he would continue to do this.He insisted on standing trial for his "crime". Socrates knew he was not guilty of anything. The reason why he was charged was because he was different from others. Although people respected him, he also had made many people angry, so the jury（陪审团）said Socrates was guilty.  
When faced with the death penalty, a person could leave Athens forever. Most people chose leave rather than die. Socrates was not like most people. Instead of telling the jury that he would go, he told them he deserved a reward. Socrates believed he had done a great service by making people think. Socrates said that he tried to "persuade every one of you not to think of what he had but rather of what he was, and how he might grow wise and good." The jury did not change its mind. Socrates was executed. He died when he drank hemlock, which is poisonous.  
Socrates was the first great Greek philosopher. He also helped to shape other philosophers that came after him. Plato, who got his start by studying with Socrates, and Aristotle, who studied with Plato, also changed Western civilization. Asking questions to discover the truth is still practiced today. And schools even today still teach this method to students.

Possible version:
  Haste Makes Waste
As we all know, there is an old saying, “Haste Makes Waste”. As is vividly shown in the picture, the couple get astonished when seeing their crops withering/ dead. The husband can’t help losing his temper, scolding his wife for her improper way of farming, while the wife argues that she simply wants the crops to grow faster by fertilizing more. She never thought too many fertilizers would cause the crops to die.
   The picture clearly conveys a message that if people are eager to finish a task in a hurry, the outcome may be less satisfactory and even goes to the opposite. As is often the case, we can’t take every detail into consideration before a quick decision is made. Under such circumstances we attach too much importance to quick speed at the expense of high quality, which eventually contributes to greater losses. Additionally, more unexpected accidents may take place when we are in a hurry.
   Remembering English words is a good case in point. If you set a goal of reciting 50 words within a short time, the result may let you down, for you forget them easily. However, if you slow down a little bit, for example, divide the words into several parts, one part at a time and go over them frequently, they can be kept longer and more easily in mind. Comparing the two methods, we find the latter is more efficient.
   In conclusion, haste makes waste. If we can apply it to our daily life, we are bound to make progress.

A
I was stopped at a red light only a mile or so from my goal of my brother’s house. We were planning to drive down together to North Carolina to be with my father who was badly ill.
As I waited at the stop light experiencing this forced slowdown, I noticed Sharper’s Florist over to the left. It was the same place where I had experienced many things— floods of memories went through my mind as the light seemed a blessing. I noticed the wine store straight ahead where my father and I had been many times before, picking out the beer of the week. We both liked German beer.
The light finally became green and I made my left turn and drove through the poor section of our hometown. I remembered how each thanksgiving my family would be together. I also remembered how my father would take some time out of each thanksgiving to make sure there was no one hungry in the neighborhoods surrounding where we lived. I can remember as a young boy going with him to deliver some food. I was scared. I had never been into this part of town this deeply before.
My father seemed unfazed (不受困扰的) by this and went about his business. The people we went to seemed to know him and gratefully accepted what he came to offer. My father seemed able to give away the food in a way that honored those he was giving to. This was not an arrogant act. He would stop at each place and talk a little, which I can remember totally pissing me off (使…厌烦). I wanted to get the hell out of there. My father wanted to be sure everyone had food. If there were people he found who didn’t have food, he would take the time to go back and get more. That’s the kind of man he was.
21. When the father was ill, he _______.	
   A. lived in North Carolina
   B. gave away food to the poor
   C. came to help the poor in his hometown
   D. stayed at the home of the author’s brother 
22. The author mentions the wine store to tell us _______.
   A. the same taste as his father			B. the life in his childhood
   C. the experience with his father		D. the birthplace of his father
23. The author was afraid of giving away food to the poor probably because _______.
   A. his father didn’t stay with him then
   B. his father didn’t take good care of him
   C. he was unfamiliar with the surroundings
   D. he had never met with so many poor people
24. The underlined word “arrogant” in the last paragraph probably means _______.
   A. angry			B. proud			C. careless		D. wild

C
Robinson Crusoe is a famous novel written by Daniel Defoe. The book tells the story of a man who is shipwrecked (遭遇海难的). He spends 28 years on an island near Venezuela. The book tells the story of everything that happens to Robinson Crusoe. He hopes someone will rescue him, but he has been there for so long on his own that he also begins to fear being rescued.
Robinson Crusoe was published in 1719. Most experts believe the story is based on the life of Alexander Selkirk, who was a Scottish sailor. On an expedition (探险) in 1704, Selkirk had an argument with his ship’s captain. Selkirk thought the ship was not safe and was about to fall apart.
When the ship stopped at a remote island to get fresh water, Selkirk got off. He tried to get the other crew members to leave with him, but nobody would. The shop then sailed away without him. Selkirk spent four years and four months on his own on the island, known as Aguas Buenas.
Selkirk was finally rescued by a ship that visited the island in 1709. The ship’s captain was grateful to Selkirk because he provided food for the crew when they arrived.
Now archaeologists think they have found the remains of Selkirk’s camp on Aguas Buenas. They found two deep holes that would have held wooden posts. The archaeologists say this is evidence that Selkirk built a shelter there. The post holes are near a fresh water stream. They are located quite high up, which would have meant that Selkirk was able to watch out for the ships coming close to the island.
The most interesting evidence, the archaeologists say, is part of a piece of equipment used by sailors to navigate (导航). Historians believe Selkirk was a navigator, so the instrument could have belonged to him.
Robinson Crusoe was published ten years after Selkirk was rescued. Most experts think Daniel Defoe heard and read stories about Selkirk, which inspired him to write the book.
28. Why did Selkirk choose to land on the remote island?
   A. Because he had quarrels with the crew members.
   B. Because the captain ordered him to get fresh water.
   C. Because he wanted to go on an adventure there.
   D. Because he thought the ship he was on was in danger.
29. We can infer from the text that the ship that visited Aguas Buenas in 1709 _______.
   A. lost its way while sailing
   B. lacked fresh water upon arrival
   C. was being navigated by Selkirk
   D. was running out of food upon arrival
30. How could Selkirk see ships that might rescue him, according to archaeologists?
   A. By asking the crew members on the ships. 
B. By sending messages to the ships’ captains.
   C. By watching from his shelter high on the island.
   D. By using a piece of equipment used to navigate.
31. The author wrote the text to _______.
   A. explain the origin of Robinson Crusoe 
B. promote sales to Robinson Crusoe
   C. criticise Alexander Selkrik’s deeds
   D. praise Daniel Defoe for his writing inspiration

D
Preventing obesity (肥胖) and smoking can save lives, but it doesn’t save money, reported researchers. “It was a small surprise, for it is against the common belief,” said Pieter Van Baal, who led the study. “But it makes sense. If you live longer, then you cost the health system more.”
The researchers found that from age 20 to 56, obese people racked up (累计) the most expensive health costs. But on average, healthy people lived 84 years. Smokers lived about 77 years, and obese people lived about 80 years. Smokers and obese people tended to have more heart disease than healthy people. Therefore in the long run, the thin and healthy group cost about $417, 000, from age 20 on. Smokers cost about $326, 000 and obese people $371, 000.
“The result throws a bucket of cold water onto the idea, based on guesswork, that obesity is going to cost trillions of dollars,” said Patrick Basham, a professor of health politics. “If we’re going to worry about the future of obesity, we should stop worrying about its financial impact,” he said.
“The benefits of obesity prevention may not be seen immediately in terms of cost saving in tomorrow’s budget, but there are long-term gains,” said Van Baal. “These are often immeasurable when it comes to people living longer and healthier lives.” In the meanwhile, he said that governments should recognize that successful smoking and obesity prevention programs mean that people will have a longer chance of dying of something more expensive later in life.
“Lung cancer is a cheap disease to treat because people don’t survive very long. But if they are old enough to get Alzheimer’s (早老性痴呆症) one day, they may survive longer and cost more. We are not advising that governments stop trying to prevent obesity,” Van Baal said. “But they should do it for the right reasons.”
32. Among middle-aged people, who may cost the health system most?
   A. Those who are heavy smokers.		B. Those who are overweight.
   C. Those who are too thin.			D. Those who are suffering from heart attacks.
33. What can we know about the belief that obesity costs much?
   A. It turns out to be incorrect.
B. It comes from scientific study. 
   C. It is based on medical evidence.
D. It has changed over the past years.
34. According to the text, governments prevent obesity for the purpose of _______.
   A. reducing the risks of suffering cancer
   B. weakening obesity’s financial impact
   C. making sure of people’s long and healthy life
   D. reducing the money spent on medical programs
35. What would be the best title for this text?
   A. Recent Medical Study Shows Truth about Health
   B. Preventing Obesity and Smoking May Cost More 
C. Obesity and Smoking Lead to Expensive Diseases
   D. Governments Change Attitude towards Obesity and Smoking

How to Be Creative
Most of us think that creativity is a quality belonging only to artists, writers, or dancers, rather than ourselves.    36    The following tips are a great beginning for developing our creativity.
1. Get out of your comfort zone
We eagerly accept the familiar and fear the unknown. Break out of your usual patterns and welcome creativity into your life. As stated earlier, the human brain was designed to recognize patterns.    37    In fact, our comfort zone is nothing more than a collection of patterns. As we become more efficient at recognizing and using patterns, we rely less on creativity to find new paths. We should force ourselves out of our comfort zones and open up new possibilities.
2. Try different things
If you always do what you’ve always done, you’ll always get what you’ve always got. We are creatures of habits and routines, and creativity hates routines. If you usually drive to work, take the subway for a few days.    38    Interrupt your routine, experiment and try something new. New things are often creative, but the same old thing never is.
3.    39    
    Having a great idea is not enough, you must work to make it a reality. Have you ever seen a new product and realized that you thought of the same thing long ago? Yet someone else is making money with “your” idea.    40    The difference between a dreamer and a doer is action. Do whatever it takes to bring your ideas to life. If you can put them into practice, you are well on your way to improving your creativity in all areas of your life.
A. Take action
B. Seek several options
C. Think from the other person’s point of view.
D. If you normally eat in the office, have lunch under a tree.
E. The truth is that we are all born with the capacity to be creative.
F. We continue to create patterns and routines for almost everything we do.
G. We all have great ideas sometimes, but only a few people turn their ideas into reality.

Dear Mike, 
How are you doing these days? 
Aimed at providing a platform where students can have a chance to exchange and make use of their books, the annual campus book fair will soon be held in our school. The fair will attract a huge crowd from the entire school, who are to sell, purchase and exchange their second-hand books with their peers. 
As a regular visitor, I’ve found myself increasingly drawn by the fair. For one thing, the fair exhibits books of hundreds of types on diverse topics, motivating us to further develop our reading habits and help to broaden our horizons. For another, most books are sold at a lower price than what the bookstores offer. 
Please let me know if you have any suggestions on how to host such a book fair better.  
                                                                   Yours,

W: Did you get the injury playing football, Jim? 
M: Yes. One of the boys kicked my foot instead of the ball. 
W: The best thing for you to do is to rest your leg for 48 hours. 
M: When can I go back to school? 
W: You can go back in 4 days, but you’ll need to avoid sports for a month. 
Text 7:
M: Hello. 
W: Hi. I’ve just been to collect your new basketball shirts from the school.  
M: Yeah, what do they look like? 
W: I don’t know if you like them as much as last season’s－you had white ones then, remember? And the yellow picture on it made it easy to see you guys on the basketball field, didn’t it? But this year they are just plain, no picture. Same color, anyway. I can bring them to your house to see what you think. 
M: OK. 
W: But it’s a bit late to change them now, I guess.  
Text 8:
W: Hello, Dan. I was sorry to hear that you had an accident last week. How did it happen and how are you feeling now? 
M: Well, I was riding on my bicycle along the street when a taxi driver suddenly made a sharp turn in front of me. I could not stop my bicycle in time and I was knocked down. Fortunately, I only got a broken arm and a broken leg. The doctor said that I would have to stay in hospital for at least a week.   
W: Do your arm and leg hurt now? 
M: Yes, my leg hurts badly, but I can bear the pain. The only thing that I’m worried about is my classes. You know, our teacher said next week we would have our mid-term exams.  
W: Well, don’t worry about the exams. I can help you. 
M: Thank you, but I don’t really want to stay here that long. Anyway, thank you for coming to see me. 
Text 9:
M: I have with me this evening Louise Graham, a group leader at Ravensfield Outdoor Adventure Center for children. Louise, how long have you been there? 
W: Well, before I first went there, two years ago, I thought I’d probably only stay for a year, but after six months or so I really started to enjoy the job. So I’ve been there ever since. To be honest, I was lacking in self-confidence, and when I first arrived, I was a bit worried about making mistakes. I was frightened I might put the children in danger because of my inexperience.      
M: What’s the best thing about your work?  
W: One thing I like is seeing them have so much fun, even if sometimes their behavior isn’t perfect. And I can suggest activities that haven’t been tried before. But there are always some children who haven’t quite got as much ability as others, and for me the most rewarding part of the job is getting them to succeed in things they haven’t managed to do before. It’s hard work though. Sometimes you are on duty at night.   
M: Mm. What do you think about that? 
W: Well, I can’t say I look forward to starting work at 10:00 p.m., but the kids have to be looked after 24 hours so someone has to do it and all the staff take turns.    
Text 10:
W: Good morning, everyone. Here is the Entertainment Guide for this week. There is another exhibition of posters in Town Hall. Last year it was early holiday posters; but this time the exhibition will be of railway posters. The exhibition opens on Monday. Admission is free, and the exhibition is open from ten until five every day. If you can spend some time there, I’m sure you will enjoy yourself. 
   There’s a special feature at the Arts Center this week. It’s the very first performance of a new play, The Rose Garden, by a local writer, Alan Brown. This is Alan’s first stage play, but many of you have enjoyed his films on television. The play will be on Saturday. Be sure to book your seats as soon as possible, if you have not done so yet. If you like his films very much, I believe this play won’t let you down. 
   There is also a film, Detective in the Shadows, being shown this Sunday at the Arts Center Cinema. Book the tickets in advance just in case that you can’t get a ticket the very day you come to see the film. The place to go to make reservations is the Tourist Center. It is open from nine-thirty until four-thirty every day except Sunday and Monday. Also, you can book tickets on the Internet, just go to www. Artcentercinema.com.

When we’re young and we dream of love and fulfillment（满足感）, we think perhaps of moon-covered Parisian nights or walks along the beach at sunset. No one tells us that the greatest moments of a lifetime are short, unplanned and nearly always catch us off guard.    
Not long ago，as I was reading a bedtime story to my seven-year-old daughter, Annie， I became aware of her focused look. She was staring at me with a faraway, blank expression. Apparently, completing The Tale of Samuel Whiskers was not as important as we first thought.    
I asked what she was thinking about.    
"Mommy," she whispered, "I just can't stop looking at your pretty face."I almost dissolved（溶解） on the spot.    Little did she know how many trying moments the glow of her sincerely loving statement would carry me through over the following years.   
Not long after, I took my four-year-old son to an elegant department store, where the sweet notes of a classic love song drew us toward a tuxedoed ( 穿晚礼服的 ) musician playing a grand piano. Sam and I sat down on a marble bench nearby, and he seemed as astonished by the pleasant theme as I was.    I didn't realize that Sam had stood up next to me until he turned, took my face in his little hands and said, "Dance with me."    
If only those women walking under the Paris moon knew the joy of such an invitation made by a round-cheeked boy with baby teeth. Although shoppers openly chuckled(咯咯笑) and pointed at us as we glided（滑行） and whirled（旋转） around the open space, I would not have traded a dance with such a charming young gentleman if I'd been offered the universe.
24. From the passage we know_______.
  A. Annie knew how important she was to her mother.
  B. shoppers didn’t notice the author dancing with her son.
  C. there are bedtime stories in the Tale of Samuel Whiskers.
  D. Sam was not surprised at the music which was played in the store.
25. When the author knew her daughter could not stop looking at her pretty face, she felt_______.
    A. sad        B. deeply moved         C. annoyed            D. ashamed
26. Why wouldn’t the author trade a dance with her son even if she was given the world?
  A. Because she knew she wouldn’t be given the universe .
  B. Because her son was the most important person to her .
  C. Because she thought she was the happiest one at the moment.
  D. Because it was very important for the author to dance with her son.
27. What does the author want to prove by showing two examples of her kids?
  A. Her kids love her very much.
  B. She enjoys staying with her kids.
  C. The greatest moments of a lifetime always come unexpectedly.
  D. Those women walking under the moon should enjoy the happiness with kids.
C
On the banks of Tanzania’s Lake Eyasi lives the world’s last hunter-gatherer tribe (部落) — the Hadza. They don’t grow food, raise animals or build houses. Instead they live a life unchanged for more than ten thousand years.
Their world is one of complete freedom — something modern society can barely imagine and is unlikely to ever experience, let alone have the skills to stay alive. Text messages and phone calls don’t exist. Nor do cars and electricity. No jobs, timetables, and social structures. No laws, taxes and unbelievably, no money — the closest thing to currency is the trade for a pair of shorts with a neighboring tribe. 
We spent our time with the Hadza hunting baboons (狒狒), a daily activity for the men. Their land is packed with sharp bushes, poisonous snakes and man-eating lions. But a successful hunting trip is the difference between eating or going hungry.  
The Hadza diet consists mainly of honey, fruit and meat. Men often hunt in pairs to shoot animals with bows and arrows. The Hadza show us how to track animals, from baboons to snakes to lions. They are hugely skilled with their handmade bows and arrows — we have a go and barely get the arrow to go three feet in front of us. 
The language of the Hadza is believed to be the oldest still-spoken language known to man. The Hadza don’t have conflict, and have no memory of starvation. Their population never reaches numbers that cannot be supported through hunting or gathering. They never get from their land more than they need.
Unlike modern-day office workers, the Hadza enjoy an extraordinary amount of free time. Their “work” — hunting for food — takes up around five hours of their day. They’ve been in such a state of peaceful existence for thousands of years.
28. We can learn from the text that the Hadza_______. 
A. lead a very primitive life        
B. live on traditional agriculture     
C. have their own system of currency  
D. show a lot of interest in new technology 
29. Which of the following can describe the Hadza’s environment? 
A. Stressful.       		B. Comfortable.  	 
C. Exciting.		 		D. Dangerous.  
30. The relationship between the Hadza and nature_______. 
A. is going wrong                   
B. is full of conflict 
C. is in perfect harmony              
D. is changing all the time 
31. Why does the author come to visit the Hadza? 
A. To study their native language.       	
B. To get to know their way of life.  
C. To learn survival skills from them.     	
D. To persuade them to protect animals.
D
Fear is hardly a new parental felling,of course. But the fear of letting our children out of sight for even a second---that’s new. And it feeds not only on reasonable worry. but also on a ste.ady diet of pressure.”powerful cultural pressures encourage parents to regard every childhood experience from the standpoint of the worst possible outcome,”says Paranoid Parenting author Frank Furedi.”To do otherwise is to be seen as an ‘inesponsible parent’”
  I received an e-mail about a father who’s following his daughter’s field trip to make sure
she’s safe，and even a mother in New York City admits that she won’t let her daughter go to the
mailbox alone as she’s afraid someone may kidnap（绑架）her daughter．How did this happen？
    “TV,”says Trevor Butterworth,an editor at a media group.．“TV exists to scare you．”
Thanks to a steady stream of those stories，it starts to feel as if  kidnappings，are happening all
the time，in any car near you．“But they’re not，”says sociologist David Finkelhor．“Crimes
against kids are down to levels we haven’t seen since the early70s．”
     The fact is，children，40 times more likely to die in a ear accident，and that doesn’t
stop us from driving them to school.But we blame parents for “letting” anything happen to their children.The “sympathetic” TV host will ask, “Why? Why did you let her go to her piano lesson alone?”
     That’s why the story about my nine-year-old son,，Izzy,riding on the subway by himself,
  was fun,” he said. Plus,being on national TV meant that be missed math class．Sometimes it
  really pays to be brave．
32 ．Frank Furedi’s words in Para，I suggest that     ·
    A．parents are under Pressure to see the dark side of society
    B ．the fear Of kids’ absence is  common for parents
    C ．it’s hard to become a responsible parent
D ．people are forced to protect their kids
33．The example of a father and a mother are used to show    ．
    A ．parents are fearfu1 about kids’s safety
    B ．parents should strictly limit their kids’ time out
    C ．Parents are nervous about road safety all the time
    D ．parents should be perfectly aware of their surroundings
34．In the author’s eyes  TV     
    A．plays a small part in reducing kid一related car accidents
    B ．is focusing too much on crimes against kids
    C ．fails to guide parents in kids’ education
    D ．make up stories about kidnappings
35．What can be the best tiile for the text？

A
	Soccer is played by millions of people all over the world, but there have only been few players who were truly great. How did these players get that way---was it through training and practice, or are great players “born, not made”? First, these players came from places that have had famous stars in the past---players that a young boy can look up to and try to imitate. In the history of soccer, only seven countries have ever won the World Cup---three from South America and four from Western Europe. There has never been a great national team---or a really great player---from North America or from Asia. Second, these players have all had years of practice in the game. Alfredo Di Stefano was the son of a soccer player, as was Pele. Most players begin playing the game at the age of three or four.
Finally, many great players come from the same kind of neighborhood---a poor, crowded area where a boy’s dream is not to be a doctor, lawyer, or businessman, but to become a rich, famous athlete or entertainer. For example, Liverpool, which produced the Beatles, had one of the best English soccer teams in recent years. Pele practiced in the street with a “ball” made of rags. And George Best learned the tricks that made him famous by bouncing the ball off a wall in the slums(贫民窟) of Belfast.
All great players have a lot in common, but that doesn’t explain why they are great. Hundreds of boys played in those Brazilian streets, but only one became Pele. The greatest players are born with some unique quality that sets them apart from all the others.[来源:学+科+网Z+X+X+K]
1.	According to the writer, which of the following statements is true?
A. Soccer is popular all over the world, but truly great players are few.
B. Millions of people all over the world are playing soccer, but only seven countries have ever had famous stars.
C. Only seven countries from South America and Western Europe have ever had national teams.
D. Soccer seems the least popular in North America and Asia.
2.	The world “tricks” at the end of Paragraph 2 is closest in meaning to ______.
A. experience      B. training         C. skills          D.cheating
3.	The Brazilian streets are mentioned to show that ______.
A. a great soccer player may be born in a slum area
B. people in poor areas are born with some unique quality

What we offer
Visitors can enjoy our displays, or watch us cleaning dinosaur bones and other fossils found on the island’s [来源:学*科*网]beaches.
The museum has a variety of different fossils, many of them never displayed to the public before. As more are discovered all the time, you can be sure of seeing something new each time you visit.
We have a free Fossil Identification Service, so you can bring in any fossils you have and find out what they are. In addition, we have a reasonably-priced Museum Shop, where you can buy a souvenir of your visit. You could also bring a picnic and relax in our special picnic area.
Activities
Fossil hunts are organized from the museum and run all year round. Groups of up to 25 are guided on a local beach where they can search for fossils. All these hunts are fully licensed and insured, and guides can help to identify any fossils found and point out things of interest.
Due to the popularity of these hunts, all trips must be booked by a personal visit to Dinosaur Farm Museum.

The BBC programme “Live from Dinosaur Island” was filmed along the coast here, and Dinosaur Farm Museum was the base for the television crew.

I turned 16 on Friday, but the Driver’s License Office in my small hometown was only open on Tuesday, so I had to wait through that extremely long weekend and an endless Monday before going in for my examination.
I came to the Driver’s License Office half an hour earlier that Tuesday morning, pacing back and forth on the worn porch waiting for the office to open at eight. I reviewed the driver’s manual for the hundredth time. I was ready. I knew the manual backward and forward; I had made an “A” in my driver’s training course, and I was a genius behind the wheel.
Finally, the door opened and a weary-looking man in a brown uniform let me in. [来源:学.科.网Z.X.X.K]
“Let me guess. You want to take the driver’s test.” his voice was not enthusiastic.
“Yes!” I answered in excitement.
“Ok, fill this out, and if you pass we’ll go for a drive.”[来源:学科网]
I grabbed the test and rushed to the desk where I filled it out in record time. A quick check showed that my paper was perfect.
“Let’s get in the car.” He tossed me a set of keys, and I slid behind the wheel. Everything was going smoothly as we pulled out of the empty parking lot. I signaled a right hand turn, and we were on a deserted street. This was going to be easy.
“Turn left and go up Young Blood Hill,” he ordered. My hometown is in the mountains, and Young Blood Hill was almost vertical (垂直的). As I eased up the steep hill and came to a stop at the top, I heard the car’s engine die. My heart sank. I would have to start it again without rolling back down the hill. I swallowed hard and turned the key; as I moved my foot from the brake, the car began to roll. I suppose I could have rolled all the way back to the bottom except for one thing. There was something behind me which stopped my roll with a rough shake and crash of glass—a police car.
The policeman wrote me a ticket as I looked over the damage, and the man from the Driver’s License Office slid behind the wheel. I waited until we had parked before I asked how long a person had to wait before taking the test again. 
9.	What time does “that Tuesday morning” in Paragraph 2 refer to?
A. The morning when he made an “A” in his driver’s training course.
B. The morning when he knew the driver’s manual perfectly well.
C. The Tuesday morning right before his 16th birthday.
D. The first Tuesday morning immediately after his 16th birthday.
10.	Why didn’t the car roll back to the bottom?
A. It hit a police car.					B. The engine died.	
C. The writer braked it hard.			
D. The man from the Driver’s License Office helped make it stop.
11.		From the underlined sentence “I grabbed the test and rushed to the desk where I filled 	it out in record time”, we can know that ______ . 
A. the writer didn’t like the man from the Driver’s License Office.
B. the writer was excited and eager to go for the driver’s test.
C. time for the test was tight.
D. the test paper was very easy.
12.	What can we learn from the last paragraph?
A. The man from the Driver’s License Office got a ticket.
B. The policeman drove the car away after the accident.
C. The writer failed the driving test.
D. The writer didn’t want to take the driving test again.

When you're surfing the Internet on your laptop from your dorm or home, do you know your personal details are being gathered secretly? And would you be surprised to know the information may be sold cheaply to advertisers and marketers?
According to an investigation by The Wall Street Journal, all it takes is a tiny file in a computer－a single code consisting of a long series of numbers and letters－to record the computer user's age, gender, location, favorite movies and hobbies.
The newspaper reports that Lotame Solutions Inc., a New York company, uses an advanced software called “beacon” to capture what people are typing on a website.
Lotame packages that data into profiles (个人资料) about individuals, only without their names, and sells the profiles to companies seeking customers. Batches of such data may be sold for a few dollars.
The Wall Street Journal survey discovered that spying on Internet users is one of the fastest­growing businesses on the World Wide Web.
The “cookie”－a tiny text file put on your PC by websites or marketing firms which might be used to remember your preferences for one site, or to track you across many sites is already old news. There are new and more complex tools such as “beacon” which scan in real time what people are doing on a webpage. These beacons instantly assess the Internet user's location, income, shopping interests and even medical conditions.
Millions of Internet users around the world also face unprecedented (空前的) threats. Private, sensitive, personal and business information is being gathered and sold without their knowledge.
Companies insist the information they gather is anonymous(匿名的) and the data is used harmlessly. But the technology has grown so powerful that even some of the biggest websites in the US don't know that they were installing intrusive files on visitors' computers. These include MSN.com and Yahoo.com.
Next time you visit a webpage and find an ad banner advertising something you've been planning to buy, don't be amazed that your computer can read your mind.
13.	The purpose of the passage is to ______.
A. introduce a tiny file in a computer－a single code
B. show how your individual information was let out when you surf the Internet
C. show how to protect your privacy
D. introduce a sophisticated software called “beacon”
14.	All of the following statements are not true EXCEPT ______.
A. Lotame sells the profiles about individuals to companies seeking customers with their age, gender, location, hobbies and names[来源:学科网]
B. spying on Internet users is the fastest­growing business on the World Wide Web
C. some of the biggest websites in the US know they were installing intrusive files on visitors' computers
D. a tiny file in a computer－a single code consisting of a long series of numbers and letters can record the user's information
15.	What’s the writer’s attitude to the issue?
A. neutral 			B. optimistic 			C. worried			D. indifferent

Wrong Reasons for Going to College
	A college education can be priceless.     16     If any of these following factors had a big influence on your decision, you’re probably right to second-guess yourself.
	Because all your friends are going.
	In only a few weeks’ time, the whole friend group will be scattered to a half dozen different colleges in a half dozen different places. Not to go will set yourself apart.     17    
Because someone else expects it from you.
	Perhaps you come from a family where everyone goes to college, or maybe you’re the kid that everyone is proud to believe will be the first to get there.     18     It’s become so much a part of the air you breathe that you’ve never stopped to consider whether you want to go or whether you’re ready to go.
	    19    
	It’s been tough to find even a summer job. You don’t have an alternative plan. Everyone else is doing it (see above). You think you might as well go to school. That is the lamest（无说服力的）of reasons to spend $ 20,000 [来源:学+科+网Z+X+X+K]or more in the next year.
	Because you are afraid you’ll regret it if you don’t go.
	Your uncle tells you that he regrets that he didn’t go to college. Others tell you they could have gone so much further in their career if only they had a college education.     20     So this is not a persuasive [来源:学.科.网Z.X.X.K]reason for you to go to college.
    A. Because you don’t want to work.
    B. Friends will wonder what’s wrong with you. 
    C. Because you don’t know what else to do. 
    D. Everyone seems more excited than you are.
    E. It seems that for years everyone has just thought that of course you’ll go. 
    F. Whatever the story is, there are always people who regret decisions they’ve made. 
    G. But maybe in your heart you know that you are going for the wrong reasons.

My father was a self-taught mandolin (曼陀铃) player. He was one of the best string   21   players in our town. He could not   22   music, but if he heard a tune a few times, he could play it. 
Dad loved to play the mandolin for his   23   for he knew we enjoyed singing, and hearing him play. He was always there,   24   his time and efforts to making sure that his family had enough in their life. I had grown into a man and had children of my own   25   I realized how much he had sacrificed.  
I joined the United States Air   26   in January of 1962. Whenever I would come home   27  , I would ask Dad to play the mandolin.

In 1950, our family moved to Maryland. While working at Todd Steel, he was   30   in an accident. On that particular day, Dad got the third index finger of his left hand   31   by the machine.   32   he didn’t [来源:学+科+网Z+X+X+K]lose enough of the finger where it would stop him picking up anything, it did   33   his ability to play the mandolin. After the accident, every time we asked him to play, he would make   34   for why he couldn’t play. Eventually, we could persuade him and he would say, “Okay. But I can’t hold down on the strings and play as well as before.” For the family it didn’t make any   35  .
In August of 1993, my father was discovered with lung cancer. He chose not to receive treatments so that he could live out the rest of his life   36   dignity. About a week before his death, we asked Dad if he would play the mandolin for us. He made excuses but said “okay”. He knew it would probably be the   37   time he would play for us. He tuned up the old mandolin and played a few   38  . When I looked around, there was not a   39   eye in the family. We saw before us a quiet man with an inner strength. Dad would never play the mandolin for us again. Dad was doing something he had done all his life,   40  . As sick as he was, he was still pleasing others. Dad surely could play that Mandolin!

Hi Sara,
As a student of your age, I understand your situation. The problem you’re facing is common among us teenagers. It is believed that we get pretty good at finding excuses to give up trying when there are obstacles in the way. The reason is that we’re creatures of routine and habit. Here are some tips on how to get moving.
First and foremost, once you’ve set a goal and decide how you’re going about it, you might as well divide it into smaller ones, so it’s easier to handle and less overwhelming. Besides, it is advisable to keep track of your progress and post motivating pictures or slogans within your sight, which in turn inspire yourself to keep pushing ahead. More importantly, keep it up until it is a habit to you.
I really hope that you can find my suggestions useful.
Yours,
Li Hua

In winter, I often walk in a nearby park during lunch time. The park is quiet, as   21   people
have the time to enjoy the winter sun on a weekday. The two people that are often seen are a middle-aged father and his little daughter   22   her school uniform. The father looks like he has all the time in the world——he   23   to hurry along the jogging path; instead he matches his pace with   24   of the little girl. Sometimes they are lying   25   in the sun, laughing and chatting.
The man certainly doesn’t look   26  . What sort of job can he have that gives him the flexibility to walk in the park in the middle of the day?
And today, we   27   sat on the rocks and had a little chat. “You   28   enjoy the park very much to come here so often,” I said. The father nodded. “How” I asked curiously, “do you
  29   to leave your office to be with your daughter every day?”
The story that the father, Satyendra Dugbey, told me showed me how, if we   30   under the surface, even ordinary people’s life can be quite   31  .
“I used to be no different from any of those thousands of office workers   32   to work every day,” he began. His wife and he were well   33   but rarely managed time off for leisure.
Everything changed after an accident   34   Dugbey was hit by a car. As he lay in hospital, terrifying thoughts   35   his mind. “How would my daughter, then only four, remember me if I died that day?” “Would my daughter have   36   of being with her father?”
The moment he recovered and went back to work, Dugbey took time off at lunch,   37   her daughter from school which was just next door to his working place, and took her to the park.
It was actually a very small change he’d made, he said, but it amazed him every day to see the difference it   38   to his life. “It brings me so much   39   that I can’t believe why others haven’t thought of doing the same thing.” he said simply.
I got up to continue my   40   walk, unexpectedly happy after his story.

As my fortieth birthday approaches, inevitable as a new hair-do, I realize how many women friends I’ve had over the years. Most have come and gone with the changes of life, just like the latest shoe fashions waltz in and out of my closet.
Some of my friends, like some of my shoes, were silly mistakes. They never did fit properly, and they always felt slightly “off”, no matter how hard I tried to fit my feet into them. Others were my absolute favorite for a while, but they wore out or wore off. All style and no substance; the quality just wasn’t there.
Then there are my true friends—the ones who, like a pair of fine shoes, never go out of style or out of favor, whose appeal and value just increase with wear and time. These are friends who stay in touch and stand by me—as if they and I have never gone off to a new state, or a new job. Physical distance does not separate us; time does not change the fundamental fact of our friendship; the wear and tear of life does not stop us. The sole still support us; the colors and lines still please us; the uppers, still strong but grown soft, gently bent around feet. Our connection is securely fastened, unaffected by the whirlwind of changes we’ve each been through, even when life carries us in different directions.
If the comparison fits…
Deborah is the evening shoe, elegant and lovely. She appreciates the finer things, choose only the best, and still looks polished long after the rest of us have drooped. She is a study in elegance and knows the difference between bone, and winter white. From this splendid treasure, I’ve come to recognize my own appreciation for the finer things in life—and to the realization that I deserved them.
Jane is that pair of essential, timeless pumps that I wear often and would be lost without. With this classic, my basic needs and comfort level are assured—leaving me time and energy for fun. I can move gracefully from day to night, from work to play, from jokes to discussion. My step is light; laughter comes easily and I am ready for adventure.
Georgiana is my pair of standard white Keds—familiar, comfortable and good for all seasons. I’ve had them since long before. They are part of my childhood. They take me home, and I am a kid again diving into the ocean on a hot summer day. They have been up the hill and through the mud with me. They keep me moving forward, even when putting one foot in front of the other feels like the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I know I can slip them tomorrow and all days after. I am indebted to these lovely worn sneakers.
In the shoe rack of life, these are the friends I cherish. They are the base upon which I stand. They accompany me on my chosen path, regardless of where it leads or how bumpy or winding it gets.

Whether you’re in the mood for poetry, essay, or fiction—the recommendations below include some examples of classics perfectly suited for November!
“Mont Blanc” (1817) by Percy Shelley
In this, one of Shelley’s most famous poems, the poet is investigating problems of mental freedom and self-positioning. The awe and wonder of nature, as a projection(投影) of the mind’s own limitless power, is an appropriate theme for this time of year.
We can, perhaps, think about our place in the universe as we watch the leaves turn, listen to the wind blow, and prepare for the “snowy, and peaceful” moments to arrive in coming months.
“Such as a feeble brook will often assume, 
In the wild woods, among the mountains lone, 
Where waterfalls around it leap for ever, 
Where woods and winds contend, and a vast river 
Over its rocks ceaselessly bursts and raves.”(Lines 7-11)
“Walden” (1854) by Henry David Thoreau
“Walden” combines autobiography with social critique(社会批判). It is partly a memoir(回忆录) of Thoreau's experience living in a place not too far from town. The book explores themes of self-reliance, simplicity, and progress while criticizing consumerism(用户至上主义) and contemporary Western culture. We might wonder about reading a book about “living in nature” at a time when the months are becoming colder, but the “comfort” of Walden, the reflection as well as the ease it inspires are perfect for this time of year.
“I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and...”
“The Eve of St. Agnes”(1820) by John Keats
“The Eve of St. Agnes” is a long poem. It was written in 1819 but not published until 1820. It is widely considered to be amongst his finest poems and was influential in 19th century literature.
Although the poem refers to the evening before St. Agnes’s day (January 20th), readers (especially in the northern hemisphere) may appreciate experiencing this one on a chilly night, perhaps one of the first of the mid-autumn season.
“ST. AGNES’ Eve—Ah, bitter chill it was!
The owl, for all his feathers, was a-cold; 
The hare limp’d trembling through the frozen grass, 
And silent was the flock in woolly fold…”
“Oliver Twist” (1838) by Charles Dickens
There’s just something about Dickens that makes you want to read him in the autumn. It may be too early for a book like “A Christmas Carol” (1843), but “Oliver Twist” is perfect for late-November reading. The story introduces us to a sickly orphaned boy living in an English workhouse. Oliver, weak and hungry, dares to ask for more food. For this insolence, he’s exiled and must suffer various hardships before finally finding solace with a caring family.
“Although I am not disposed to maintain that being born in a workhouse, is, in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this particular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that…”
46. According to the passage, reading “Mont Blanc” can help us ________.
A. learn something about the miserable life of an orphan
B. appreciate experiencing the atmosphere of chilly nights
C. try to find our own position in this world
D. inspire us to experience living simply and easily
47. Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage?
A. Both Mont Blanc and the Eve of Saint Agnes are not collections of poems
B. “Walden” (1854) by Henry David Thoreau was intended for naturalists
C. “The Eve of St. Agnes” by Keats was written much later than A Christmas Carol by Dickens
D. All the works were produced in November
48. For each masterpiece, the added original lines and sentences aim to ________.
A. tell something about the background of the work
B. introduce the writing style of the work
C. keep the readers more informed about the writer
D. help the readers have a taste of the masterpieces 
49. The four masterpieces are arranged ________.
A. according to time	B. at random      
C. in the order of the letters	D. according to influence
C
Reading, unlike speaking, is a young activity to some degree. Humans have been speaking in some form for hundreds of thousands of years; we are born with the ability to acquire speech. The earliest writing, however, came only 6,000 years ago, and every act of reading remains a version of what my son is learning: identifying letters and words, use much the same of brain as we use to identify trees, cars, animals and telephone boxes.
It’s not only letters and words that we process as objects. Texts themselves, so far as our brain is concerned, are physical landscapes. So it is not surprising that we respond differently to words printed on a page compared to words appearing on a screen.
For her new book, Words Onscreen: The Fate Of Reading in a Digital World, professor Naomi Baron conducted a survey of reading preference among over 300 universities across the world. When given a choice between media ranging from printouts to smart phones, laptops, desktops and e-readers, 92% of the respondents replied that it was hard copy that best allowed them to concentrate.
This isn’t a result likely to surprise many editors, or anyone else who works closely with text. While writing this article, I gathered my thoughts through a version of the same principle: having collected and checked my notes onscreen, I printed said notes, wrote all over the resulting printout, argued with myself in the margins, placed marks next to key points and then draw my own clear conclusion.
Across three experiments in 2013, researchers Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer compared the effectiveness of students taking hand-notes versus typing onto laptops. Their conclusion: the relative slowness of writing by hand demands heavier mental lifting, forcing students to sum up rather than to quote, therefore tending to increase the students ability of understanding, applying, and memorizing.
In other words, reading from paper is good—at least as far as the brain is concerned. Moreover, the handwriting itself can be significant. In a 2012 study at Indiana University, professor Karin James tested five-year-old children who didn’t know how to read or write by asking them to reproduce a letter or a shape in one of the three ways: typed on to the computer, drawn on a blank sheet, or copied over dotted lines. When the children were drawing freehand, their brain had the similar activities to adults’ reading and writing. The other two methods showed no such brain activities. Similar effects have been found in other tests, suggesting not only a close link between reading and writing, but that the experience of reading itself differs between letters learned through handwriting and those learned through typing. A conclusion was drawn that handwriting tends to lift up our brain more than the placeless, weightless scrolling of words on screen.
However, there is also a scientific recognition that many of the screen’s advantages—search, boundless and bottomless capacity, links and leaps and seamless navigation—are either unhelpful or destructive when it comes to certain kinds of reading and writing.
Above all, it seems to me, we must give up the concept that there is only one way of reading, or that technology and paper can never be put together. We’re lucky enough to have more opportunities to make our choice.
50. What does the writer probably mean by saying “Reading is a young activity” in Paragraph 1?
A. Reading is an activity for children      
B. Reading develops your brain into being young
C. Reading came into being just recently
D. Reading was applied by humans later than speaking
51. According to the passage, reading from paper does not mean reading from ________.
A. hard copy	B. printouts	C. iPhone	D. journals 
52. Reading from paper is more helpful for concentrating because ________.
A. it is a young activity to a degree	B. it involves more brain activities than its opponents
C. it demands more physical lifting	D. it has boundless and bottomless search capacity
53. The 2012 study at Indiana in Paragraph 6 was intended to ________.
   A. deny the three experiments by Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer
B. offer a more convincing evidence of the writer’s point of view
C. show how powerful our children’s reading capacity can be
D. echo or support the survey conducted by professor Naomi Baron
54. The writer’s attitude towards handwriting can be best described as ________.
A. tolerant	B. negative	C. neutral	D. positive
Ｄ
She was working on some history essay. Her books were open on the desk, and she had an A4 pad there and some pencils ready for taking notes.
As I watched, she sat back on her chair, and she took up her history book. But much as she tried to read it, and much as she tried to concentrate, her eyes kept glancing up at those old photographs. There were a photograph of me on my own and a photograph of the two of us together. There was also a photo of when Eggy was small and when I was only a baby—maybe I had even just been born. And she was holding me, with Dad’s help, while Mom looked on, rather nervously, as if worried that Eggy might drop me on my head. Then there were photos of her and me, both of us getting bigger and older. And she was always three years ahead of me, always my big sister, and I was always her naughty little brother, driving her nuts and getting her on her nerves.
There was a photograph of all of us too, of me and Eggy and Mum and Dad, all standing there together, smiling at the new camera.
There I was. And there we were. And nothing would ever bring us back or make us whole again. I felt so sad again—but I wouldn’t give in to it. I was on a mission, like they say, and I had to see it through. I had to settle the unfinished business. I had to forgive and be forgiven. I couldn’t let Eggy go through the rest of her life remembering those last words she’d ever said to me, just before I stormed out to get run over by a truck. 
“You’ll be sorry one day when I am dead!” I said to her.
“No, I won’t be!” she’d shouted after me, “I’ll be glad!”
And then I’d never come back.
“Eggy,” I said, “Eggy, it’s Harry. I am here, right by you. Right here. But don’t be afraid. It’s OK, Eggy, I am a ghost now, that’s all. But it’s OK, it’s nothing to be frightened of. I am not going to haunt you for ever. I just came back to work things out with you, to say I am sorry. Can you hear me, Eggy? Do you know I am here?” But she looked back down at her history book, reached out and turned a page over. And she didn’t know that I was standing right behind her, so close that I could reach out and touch her.
“I am touching your shoulder, Eggy. Can you feel my hand? Can you? It’s me, Harry. Don’t be afraid. I am just touching your shoulder, that’s all.”
But she went on reading the history book, and then paused, and took up one of the pencils, and made a few notes about Henry the Eighth and all the wives he once had and why he had them.
“Eggy, —it’s me.”
“Eggy…”
Nothing.
She looked up from her book, daydreaming maybe, like you do in the middle of your homework. Her eyes fell on the photos of her and me at my fourth birthday party. My getting ready to blow out all the candles. Her getting ready to help me in case I ran out of air.
“Oh, Harry,” she said. “Oh, Harry.” And she reached out and touched the photo, just like it was flesh and blood but not just____________.
I saw the pencil on the desk. I remembered the leaf on the tree, Jelly’s Parker, and Arthur with the fruit machine. I could do it. I knew I could. I had to. I focused my thoughts on the pencil, all of them, every part of me. I tried to shine my thoughts upon it as if they were the beam of a torch.
“Please,” I thought, “please, please, please…”
55. How many photographs do you think there are on Eggy’s desk at least?
A. 4	B. 5	C. 6	D. 7
56. The unfinished business mentioned in Paragraph 4 probably means ______.
A. having more photos taken with Eggy	B. expressing his being sorry to Eggy
C. saying good-bye to Eggy	D. returning the school things to Eggy
57. Which of the following ways of writing impresses you most in the story?
A. Giving a definition 		B. Giving an example 
C. Repeated words  		D. Making a comparison
58. Which of the following can be put in the blank in the story?
A. paper and chemicals	B. tears and laughter	C. life and death	D. trial and error
59. It can be inferred from the passage that at the end of the story Harry probably will_______.
A. “write” something		B. “take away” the pencil
C. “steal” the pencil		D. “break off” the pencil angrily
60. What might be the best title for the passage?
A. A Trustworthy Brother		B. An Unforgettable Accident
C. A Regular Guest   		D. A Special Mission
第二节：下面文章中有5个段落需要添加小标题（第61～65题）。请从以下选项（A、B、C、D、E和F）中选出适合各段落的小标题，并在答题纸上将相应选项的标号涂黑。选项中有一项是多余选项。
A. Enjoy meeting new people.
B. Live in the moment.
C. Expect the unexpected.
D. Appreciate the life you have.
E. Relax and Have Fun.
F. Respect other cultures.
Traveling has many benefits. It’s no wonder that so many people love to travel and some even consider traveling as part of their routine lifestyle. Perhaps the reasons for people from all walks of life, both old and young, enjoying traveling are as follows:
61. __________ You never know what is going to happen when you are traveling. When you are an inexperienced traveler, you are immediately thrown into a situation where you do not always know what to do. It’s easy to become anxious when you don’t know what is coming up next, but just be patient and let things unfold. Flights will be delayed, or you might not know where your next meal is coming from. Be prepared financially for unexpected things, because you will probably spend more money than you planned on.
62. __________ Experienced travelers learn very quickly to adapt to new situations and  environments. It may be easy to forget that you are there to relax and enjoy yourself. Relaxation is one of the top benefits of travel. Just enjoy wherever you are, and take things in as they happen. You will learn unexpected things that way. So, you might as well relax wherever you are, and have a good time, especially when things do not go as planned.
63. __________ Being in new countries and around strangers all the time can be stressful and make you uncomfortable. But you should have faith that most people you meet will be pleasant to deal with. Your attitude is the most important thing when you meet new people. You may not be able to understand them, but you will gain the most if you just show them respect as human beings. Learn how to enjoy being around new people and don’t be afraid to talk to them.
64. __________ Most people are used to doing the same routine in their lives. We get used to our jobs, our friends, and our usual places that we go for fun. Traveling takes you away from all that but it makes you feel more alive. You learn to trust your instincts in a new situation and allow yourself to just appreciate each moment for what it is. You see things you have never seen before. When you learn to be in the moment of right now, you are more aware of everything going on around you. 
65. __________ When you travel outside of your world, you will notice right away the cultural differences. People might dress differently. They might communicate in a language you don’t know and their lives may appear to be so unfamiliar to you. Here you learn to respect who people are. You see them and acknowledge that they live in a world apart from you. It makes you think about the world on a bigger scale. It makes you more aware of some of the ways that other people struggle in their lives.

The Netherlands on Monday introduced its first-ever intelligent bicycle, fitted with electronic devices to help bring down the high accident rate among elderly cyclists in the bicycle-mad country. 
Developed for the government by the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), the intelligent bicycle, runs on electricity. A commercial-available bicycle is expected to be on the market in the next two years and should sell for between 1, 700 to 3, 200 euros per bicycle. 
The devices on the bike are linked through an onboard computer with a vibrating (震动的) warning system fitted in the bicycle's saddle and handlebars to warn cyclists of the coming danger.
The saddle vibrates when other cyclists approach from behind, while, the handlebars do the same when barriers appear ahead. 
"Accidents often happen when cyclists look behind them or get a fright when they are passed at high speed," said Maurice Kwakkernaat, one of TNO's research scientists involved in the project. "The onboard system technology has already been at work in the car industry," he said. 
''More and more elderly people are using a bicycle, not only for short distances, but also for longer distances," Dutch Environment and Infrastructure Minister Melanie Schultz van Haegen told AFP. "This type of bicycle is truly needed in the Netherlands because it will help us bring down the number of elderly people who are injured every year and allow them to continue to enjoy cycling," she said. 
In the Netherlands, bicycles outnumber the population of 17 million by at least one million and there are some 25,000 km of bicycle path in the country. Those statistics are set to grow as more and more people take to two-wheeled transport, leading to an increased risk of injury. 
Last year, 184 cyclists died in the country, of which 124, or 67%, were older than 65, according to the Central Statistics Office. The year before, 200 cyclists died, the majority of victims also being elderly. 
The current model weighs 25 kilograms but researchers are working on making the onboard systems smaller. 
24. The intelligent bicycle is aimed to ________. 
	A. protect the environment             	B. help reduce traffic pressure
	C. popularize the use of bicycles         	D. improve safety for elderly cyclists
25. Which part of the intelligent bicycle will vibrate when another cyclist was suddendly found ahead ?
	A. The handlebars.                          	B. The wheels. 
	C. The saddle.                       	D. The onboard computer. 
26. We can learn from the passage that ________. 
	A. the elderly ride bicycles wherever they go	B. the accident rate among elderly cyclists is high
	C. the number of elderly cyclists is decreasing	D. the elderly are planning to give up cycling
27. Which is the best title for the passage?
	A. A Test Bicycle                        	B. Elderly Cyclists
	C. A Smart Bicycle                       	D. A Bicycle-mad Country

An American woman has been held by authorities in China for the past six months accused of stealing state secrets. Mrs Phan-Gillis, a naturalised American born in Vietnam, was detained in March, during a trade visit to promote the Texan city of Houston. Sandy Phan-Gillis's husband Jeff Gillis says she is now being moved to a more secure facility.
    China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said on Tuesday that Mrs. Phan-Gillis was "suspected of carrying out activities endangering national security, and is currently being investigated by relevant departments"."We hope that the outside world will respect China's handling of this case according to law," he added.
    Mrs Phan-Gillis was president of the Houston Shenzhen Sister City Association and consulted for Chinese and US businesses. One of her colleages in the trip told the BBC "there was nothing out of the ordinary" about the trip but described the sequence of events as they left China as "bizarre". They had been travelling around China for about a week when the group went through immigration control at the border between Guangdong and Macau, in Zhuhai, on 19 March.
   The group became separated, regrouping on the other side - without Mrs Phan-Gillis.After returning to Houston several days later, Mr Gillis told them that the US consulate had informed him his wife had been detained, accused of stealing state secrets.
    Her family vigorously deny the accusations, which they say have never been properly explained. Since then, consular officials have been able to visit Mrs Phan-Gillis periodically, to check up on her health, which her husband says is poor, and to pass on messages.
    The US embassy in Beijing would not comment on the story and referred the BBC to the US Department of State in Washington, which was closed at the time of enquiry.
28. What do we know about Mrs Phan-Gillis according to the passage?
A. A Vietnamese who goes to China on business.
B. She went on a trade visit with her husband.
C. A consultant for Chinese and US businesses of the Houston Shenzhen Sister City Association 
D. An American who has been held by Chinese government.
29. What is the attitude of China’s authorities toward this issue?
A. Mrs Phan-Gillis is guilty of stealing China’s state secrets.
B. They do not confirm the investigation of Mrs Phan-Gillis
C. Whether Mrs Phan-Gillis is guilty or not is still under investigation.
D. They are expecting other countries’ intervene.
30. What is the American government’s reaction to this event?
A. positive			B. negative			C. unclear  			D. neutral
31. What can we infer from the passage?
A. The family of Mrs Phan-Gillis think she is innocent.	
B. The Chinese relevant governments are using some illegal methods to get things done.		
C. Mrs Phan-Gillis have been to China for many times. 	
D. Mrs Phan-Gillis was detained during a trade visit to promote the Texan city of Houston.

    Like many old towns in the forested valleys of the Northwest, Albany, Ore, has seen its share of ups and downs over the years, but when the local economy began to decline some 15 years ago, the downs seemed to outnumber the ups.
   "Albany was changing completely. We had to find a way to reinvent ourselves," says Wendy Kirbey, the former owner of a coffee shop downtown. So in 2002,Kirbey,69,proposed (提议) a project she hoped would help her town rediscover its pride: a Victorian-style carousel (旋转木马),the animals carved by the townspeople themselves.
   "It felt like the perfect fit for our historical town," she says. Despite a sceptical city council (议会) and a starting budget of only $ 150,Kfrbey and a handful of volunteers got to work.
   Ten years later, more than 300 people have spent nearly 150,000 hours on the Albany Carousel, making a lively herd of unusual creatures. Each of the 52 animals has been "adopted" by a sponsor, who oversees its creation and often adds a personal touch.
   The project has shown the diverse skills and creative talents of Albany (pop. 50,000). "The amazing thing about this attempt is that whenever we’ve needed something, it’s been provided for us," says Kirbey. "Somebody's aunt knows somebody's uncle who comes down to lend a hand".
     Kirbey says it will take two more years to complete the project. But the carousel is already working its magic. "It is our town’s No. 1 attraction," says Rod Porsche of the Albany Visitors Association. As the animals are completed, they're put on show in local hotels, restaurants and shops; people who come to see the fantastical figures around town and tour the workshop (as many as 2,000 visitors a month) are helping Albany with its economic recovery. "I can’t imagine how great it’s going to be when the carousel is up and running," Porsche says.
32. What can we learn about the carousel?
   A. It cost a fortune.                           B. It looks very modern.
   C. It received support from all walks of life.       D. It took ten years to build.
33. By saying the underlined sentence, Kirbey wants to tell us_______ .
   A. the townspeople are closely linked            B. it is a small world
   C. uncles and aunts make great efforts           D. help is at hand
34. What can we infer from the last paragraph?
 A. Porsche has made an outstanding contribution to Albany.  
B. Porsche is sceptical of the town-s attractions.
 C. Porsche has made many friends through the project.      
D. Porsche thinks highly of the project.
35. The text is mainly about_______.
 A. how a struggling town found a way to create a little magic   B. the ups and downs of Albany
 C. how the carousel would help a town recover its culture      D. the creative talents of Albany

The benefits of keeping a journal (日志)
 If you want to grow, one important thing you should do is keeping a journal. It may seem simple, but it can make a big difference in your life. I have been keeping journals for years. Writing all the lessons I learn and all the ideas I get has become a habit for me.   36   Here are some benefits you will get by keeping a journal. 
◆ It prevents you from losing an idea. Have you ever gotten an idea only to lose it later because you didn’t write it down?    37    But then I developed the habit of writing down every idea that came into my mind as soon as possible. If I’m away from my computer, I usually write it down on a piece of paper that I bring wherever I go. I will then transfer the idea to the journal in my computer.
◆ It helps you review all the lessons you’ve learned. By reviewing your journal, you can quickly see the lessons you’ve learned and the ideas you’ve gotten.   38   You can use the ideas to propel (鞭策) yourself forward.
◆   39   After keeping a journal for years, you can look back at it and see how far you’ve gone. Things that were big problems in the past might seem small today. The raw ideas you had in the past might have been realized today. 
◆ It helps you expand your ideas. When you try to come up with a sentence to express an idea, you are thinking actively about it.   40   In the end, you will expand your ideas.
A. I often experienced that myself.
B. It trains you to express your thoughts.
C. It allows you to see your progress over time.
D. Just use whatever tool you feel comfortable with.
E. Thinking actively helps you connect your idea to another idea.
F. And to be honest, I can’t imagine what my life would be like without it.
G. Then you can do whatever necessary to avoid repeating the same mistakes.

Dear Bob,
   Last week I did a survey among the students in my class on what university they want to choose. Now I’m writing to tell you the results.
 Twenty-five percent of my classmates want to choose universities in our province. They say they are more likely to be admitted if they apply to these universities. And they needn’t change their lifestyle too much. Seventy percent of them would like to choose universities in other provinces. Being away from home, they can become more independent and there are more universities for them to choose from. The rest five percent of my classmates plan to choose foreign universities. One reason why they want to go abroad is that they can learn more about different cultures. Besides, it will be a great help to their foreign language study.
  Yours,
Li Hua

A
Two days ago I was woken up at 1 am. My roommate stood at the door (she was returning from a club) along with a huge middle-aged man with long hair. “Please let him in,” she told me, “He has been locked out of his apartment.” She had seen him, cold and shivering (it had snowed the previous night) and immediately asked him to sleep at our place. He was a law student in his fifties who had been doing his homework at the Laundromat (自助洗衣店) when he found he had left his keys in his house.
    I have never had a strange man sleep in my house before. My roommate and I are both less than 5 feet and we have been asked not to speak to strangers since we were kids. Not to mention that we’re in a new city that we have lived in for less than a month. He accepted our kindness with hesitation and as soon as dawn broke he left.
    The next day he came to our house, saying he owed us big time for not being frozen out in the cold. He left us a beautiful card saying—“Thank you so much. Your actions are so sincere.”
Later he cooked us a wonderful simple “thank you” dinner over which he told us about his life (a coach, a guide, a law student). He told us how he was completely touched by our concern for a total stranger. I learnt a lot that evening. As he talked about how once he brought a homeless man in to eat Christmas dinner with his family, I was deeply touched.
    My roommate taught me a huge lesson: Let go of your fear; always leave the door of compassion (同情) open and you can never go wrong. 
21. From the first paragraph we can infer that _______. 
A. the writer came back from a club earlier
B. the writer’s roommate was kind-hearted
C. the writer’s roommate often came back late
D. the man wanted to find a job at the Laundromat

Celebrity TV presenter Ju Ping has been a host on China Central Television for 30 years, but her recent experience hosting a charity event was one of the most special moments in her career.
On April 2, World Autism (自闭症) Day, Ju partnered with Xia Junqi, a 17-year-old autistic teenager, to host a charity gala at the Beijing National Aquatics Center, otherwise known as the Water Cube.
The event was organized by One Foundation, which aims to increase public awareness of autistic people and their needs.
Autism is a neural disorder that can impair sufferers’ communication skills and social interactions. Sufferers have restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior. It affects about 1.6 million people in China, with medical studies suggesting autism may affect one in every 166 children.
Autism has no cure. For many years it went largely undiagnosed in China but early intervention (干预，治疗) and continuous education may help to teach the autistic self-help skills and lessen their problematic behavior.
The gala(晚会) featured autistic children singing, dancing and performing, and was greeted with enthusiastic applause from the audience.
Cai Chunzhu, a celebrity playwright, recalled feeling heartbroken when his son was diagnosed with autism at the age of 2. He says his family struggled to accept the reality but finally made peace with the diagnoses in the past four years. He says the boy lives in his own world and is trained in an intervention facility. Sun Zhongkai, executive director of the Beijing Stars and Rain Institute for Autism, one of the earliest intervention facilities for autistic children in China, shared with audience his deep sorrow for parents who often broke down with desperation when he told them there was no cure for their autistic children.
Over the years, Chinese society has become more supportive of autistic people and their families, but there are still challenges in terms of getting autistic people employed and looking after them when their parents pass away.
	Actor Zhou Xun also called on society to show greater understanding and support toward autistic children and their families.
25. The underlined word “impair” in Paragraph 4 most probably mean?
A. cause		B. improve 		C. increase 		D. damage 
26. Which of the following statements about Autism is FALSE?	
A. It is a kind of illness that cannot be cured.
B. Nothing can be done about it.
C. People in China were not well aware of it in the past.
D. A lot of children suffer from it in China.
27. What can we know from Paragraph 7?
A. It is quite difficult for parents to accept that their children have autism.
B. Training in an intervention facility can stop children with autism living in their own world.
C. There is only one intervention facility for autistic children in China.
D. Doctors often break down when they tell parents their children have autism.
28. Where does this text probably come from?
	A. A TV interview.		 	B. A medicine magazine.
	C. A newspaper.	    	D. A book review.

Even if you’re not an astronomy fan, chances are that you can easily recognize certain constellations (星座) and stars such as the Big Dipper (北斗七星) and the North Star.
The North Star is the brightest star in the constellation known as the Little Dipper. It is so-called because of the special position. If you were to stay up all night looking at the stars, you’d slowly see them move around a point in the sky known as the North Celestial Pole.
You would notice, however, that one star remains still. This is the North Star, so named for its location almost directly in line with the North Celestial Pole.
Due to its position in the sky, at one time sailors used the North Star as a navigational tool. By measuring the angle between the northern horizon and the North Star, a navigator could accurately determine the ship’s latitude.
But latitude, or the imaginary lines stretching across the globe parallel to the equator, was not enough to plot a ship’s location. Knowing latitude only allowed navigators to locate themselves on a particular latitude line at a particular distance from the equator. It was only with the invention of a way to accurately measure longitude that precise navigation became possible.
Although the North Star is no longer used by navigators, it remains a heavenly symbol of human curiosity and exploration.
33. Which of the following statements about the North Star is TRUE?
  A. The North Star is the brightest star in the night sky.
B. The North Star, together with some other stars, make up the Little Dipper.
C. The North Star moves along the same course with other stars.
D. The North Star is exactly located in line with the North Celestial Pole.
34. What can be inferred from the passage?
  A. The North Star could help navigators set a straight course of their ship in the past.
  B. Real lines that are parallel to the equator are called “latitude”.
  C. Either latitude or longitude could make precise navigation possible.
  D. Now the North Star is no longer a navigational tool used by sailors.
35. Which is probably the best title of the passage?
A. What is a navigational tool?  	
B. What can be called the earliest GPS?
C. What makes the North Star so special?	
D. What is the symbol of human exploration?

Red envelops have related to the Chinese Lunar New Year for long. I myself have had plenty of experiences both receiving and giving our red envelops in the past and    __36   I mean, who doesn’t love free money?
I’m truly surprised by the degree of people’s obsession(迷恋) with red envelops this year. In fact, everyone I know spent at least a day or two crazily shaking their smart phones,  37  Thanks to messaging app WeChat’s new feature that allows users to send money electronically, grabbing red envelopes has never seemed so easy.
Just in case you are one of the very few people who still can’t be involved in the game,   38   Givers link their WeChat(微信) to their bank accounts, and then they can send specified amounts of money to their WeChat contacts through a personal message. They can also put the cash up for grabs in chat group full of friends, and anyone who acts fast enough will get a share. Later, receivers can transfer the funds from their WeChat back into their own bank accounts.
___39   I’m always for some harmless fun in life, so my natural response would be: why not? Moreover, I’ve always believed that it’s human nature to want free stuff, regardless of whether you actually need it or not. This may not be a good quality, but it’s not against the law, so I won’t get all judgmental here.  40   I really can’t blame anyone for their enthusiasm in grabbing red envelops. I would have done it too, had I not thought linking WeChat to my bank accounts was too much trouble.
A. Considering these reasons,
B. here’s how it works.
C. generally speaking, it’s been fun.
D. In theory, this sounds like a fun game.
E. In terms of all the advantages above,
F. mostly trying to get as much as lucky money as possible.
G. In fact, it does harm to our life.

They were told that a simple piece of aluminum foil(锡纸) hid in the hat can help. Your silent words   56  off the foil. Angels capture the words and they carry up to God.”
   At the performance, I did just as told to. With my eyes   57  on her hat, the fact that none present could hear my voice didn’t  58   . My silent singing was for God’s ears   59  .
Four years ago Aunt Dolly died at 90. Her hat, which helped us overcome life’s     60   , just lay there.

Recently, the Ministry of Education has issued a requirement which students should be given labor education while at the school, which arouses a heated debate.
As for students, opinion are divided. Some students think that it will be great benefit for their health, enabled them to be well developed. On the other hand, some students hold the view that this kind of education will take up our time, which will be spent studying otherwise. But it will have a negative effect on their grades.
It was true that students are given little chance of laboring nowadays, thus lacking the sense of labor. So as far as I am concerned, students definite should receive labor education so that they will value more that labor brings about.

Dear Peter, 
With the development of the modern society and improvement of living standards, smart phones have brought great convenience to ordinary people. However, mobile phones can bring some problems. Recently, I made a research on the phenomenon that drivers tend to play with their mobile phones while driving.
80.8%of the interviewees find it common that drivers use their phones while driving. 45.6% owe it to the driver’s overconfidence in their driving skills. Furthermore, 70.8%highly recommend severe punishment.
As far as I am concerned, drivers should not play with their mobile phones when driving. Much attention on phones can distract them from driving and lead to traffic accidents. What’s more, serious road accidents can cause injuries and deaths. Therefore, drivers should raise their sense of responsibility and avoid using phones when driving.

I know a doctor who is an expert in the area of nuclear medicine and is regarded by his peers as one of the most brilliant in his field.
When I asked him about his feelings concerning his 　16　, he responded as follows, and 　17　me to present:
"As far as I am concerned, a day will come, many years in the 　18　, where people will look at this science of nuclear medicine and they will 　19　it to a craft practiced by witch doctors(巫医). They will wonder how people could have been so 　20　to use radioactive dyes in the nuclear imaging process. They will 　21　my published research and think that I must have been a foolish doctor."
He further explained, " 　22　of the day can be the stupidity of tomorrow. The scholars who 　23　my work today will be denied by the intellectuals of tomorrow. I am not 　24　by their high regard of my 　25　because I know a day will come in the future where we are all regarded as having been miserable 　26　."
"Ever hear of a guy named Aristotle? In his day, he was considered to be a 　27　. Of course, he also believed 　28　in the concept that the sun revolved around the earth. Years later, he would be 　29　by Galileo and Copernicus, who no doubt considered Aristotle to be a total fool."
He concluded by stating, "I find certain scientists to be the most 　30　people I know, generally, totally 　31　, and convinced that they have the answer to all problems. In my mind, a reasonably 　32　person is the fellow who recognizes that life is little more than a lot of questions 　33　answers, and one answer should only lead to another question.

"Plants were expected to get larger with increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but changes in temperature, humidity and nutrient availability seem to have trumped the benefits of increased carbon dioxide," said researchers from the National University of Singapore.
45 percent of the species studied now reach smaller adult sizes than they did in the past. The researchers point out that warmer temperatures and changing habitats, caused by climate change, are possible reasons for the shrinking of creatures.
"We do not yet know the exact mechanisms involved, or why some organisms are getting smaller while others are unaffected," the researchers said. "Until we understand more, we could be risking negative consequences that we can’t yet quantify."
The change was big in cold-blooded animals. Only two decades of warmer temperatures were enough to make reptiles(爬行动物) smaller. An increase of only 1℃ caused nearly a 10 percent increase in metabolism(新陈代谢). Greater use of energy resulted in tiny tortoises and little lizards. Fish are smaller now too. Though overfishing has played a part in reducing numbers, experiments show that warmer temperatures also stop fish growth. There is a recent report on warmer temperatures’ negative effects on plankton(浮游生物),the base of the marine ecosystem.
Warm-blooded animals weren’t immune from the size change caused by climate change. Many birds are now smaller; Mammals have been miniaturized too. Soay sheep are thinner. Red deer are weaker. And polar bears are smaller, compared with historical records. This isn’t the first time this has happened in Earth’s history.
55 million years ago, a warming event similar to the current climate change caused bees, spiders and ants to shrink by 50 to 75 percent over several thousand years. That event happened over a longer time than the current climate change.
The speed of modern climate change could mean organisms may not respond or adapt quickly enough, especially those with long generation times. So, it is likely that more negative influences of climate change will be shown in the future.
36．Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?
A.Why do some species become smaller?
B.How does climate change in Earth’s history?
C.Climate change has many negative effects
D.Species become smaller as climate warms
37．The underlined word "trumped" in the first paragraph can be replaced by "　　　".
A.increased	B.beaten	C.strengthened	D.equaled
38．Researchers from the National University of Singapore believe that 　　　.
A.how climate change affects animals’ sizes has not been found clearly
B.all the animals on the Earth have become smaller
C.too many studies on animals’ sizes have been done
D.climate change has more negative effects on warm-blooded animals
39．What can we learn from the passage?
A.Climate change has even affected plankton negatively.
B.Birds have suffered more from climate change than fish.
C.Cold-blooded animals become smaller because of the lack of food.
D.The warming event has never happened in Earth’s history before.
 
The Pew report---which was based on surveys carried out in Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Greece, Poland and the Czech Republic --- concluded that the European Union was “ the new sick man of Europe”.
The percentage of Europeans with a favorable view of the EU has plunged from 60 percent last year to 45 percent now.
The UK may be considered the most Eurosceptic(欧洲怀疑论者)country, but its support for the union has barely changed in the past 12 months, slipping only two points to 43 percent.
By contrast, France’s backing for the EU has slipped sharply, from 60 percent last year to 41 percent today.
On the question of whether to remain in the EU, 46 percent of the British want to leave the union and surprisingly, the same percentage went to stay.
The Pew report’s authors said, “The long-drawn economic crisis has created bad forces that are pulling European public opinion apart, separating the French from the Germans and Germans from everyone else.”
They added, “The effort over the past half century to create a more united Europe is now the main disaster of the euro crisis. The European project now stands in a bad reputation across much of Europe.”
The only European leader rated highly by their own voters was the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with 74 percent voters in favor of her.
Prime Minister David Cameron was the next highest with a positive score of 37 percent among the British public, although he can take some comfort from the fact that 58 percent of Poles and half of all French people think he is doing a good job.
In spite of the dark economic future and growing doubt of the EU, there were strong majorities of more than 60 percent in favor of keeping the euro in the five countries surveyed that use the single currency.
40．Which of the following is TRUE about the recent Pew report?
A.The UK has the smallest number of people against the EU.
B.There’s a slight change of the UK’s support for the EU.
C.More than half the Germans raise doubt about the EU.
D.A vast majority of French people are in favor of the EU.
41．As to whether to remain in the EU, ______.
A.the British are divided equally	B.few British want to stay
C.half British want to leave	D.many British don’t care about it
42．What’s the Pew report’s authors’ attitude towards the relation between France and Germany?
A.Enthusiastic.	B.Optimistic.	C.Negative.	D.Neutral.
43．Why does Prime Minister David Cameron feel a little bit comfortable?
A.Only a score of 37 percent of Britons go against him.
B.Many of the Poles and French think well of him.
C.More than 60 percent of the Europeans are in favor of keeping the euro.
D.Angela Merkel has 74 percent voters supporting her.
 
Loch Ness, the largest freshwater lake in the British Isles, is twenty four miles long and, at one point, one mile wide. It has an average depth of four hundred and fifty feet and at times drops close to a thousand. It is cold and murky(浑浊的), with dangerous currents. In short, it is the perfect place to hide a monster from even the sharpest eyes of science.
The Loch Ness Monster, also called Nessie, is supposedly living in this area. The earliest recorded sighting of the Loch Ness Monster was in the biography of Life of St. Columba by Adamnan in the year AD 565. The monster apparently attacked a man who was swimming in the River Ness.
The monster didn’t make headlines again until August 27, 1930, when 3 fishermen reported seeing a creature with 20 feet long approaching their boat, throwing water in the air. In 1933, after a new road was built along the edge of the Loch, the number of reports rose suddenly. Early in 1934, Author Grant, a young student, was out on his motorcycle one evening when he almost ran into the monster as it crossed the road. Grant’s description of the thing — small head, long thin neck and tail with a big body, seemed to match the appearance of the plesiosaur(蛇颈龙), an aquatic(水生的) type of dinosaur that has been extinct(已灭绝的)for 65 million years.
The Loch Ness Investigation Bureau was formed in 1962 to act as a research organization for information about the creature. Even now, efforts have continued to find the monster. A great deal of information was discovered about the Loch, but they haven’t yet to produce any specific evidence of a monster.
Skeptics(怀疑论者) argue that the water in the Loch is too cold for a plesiosaur to live in. They also argue that an air-breathing animal, like a whale or seal, would spend much more time on the surface than the creature seems to, and would be spotted more often.
Some scientists have wondered if the sightings might be caused by an underwater wave which is known to sometimes occur in deep, long, and cold lakes, like Loch Ness. Such a wave might push debris(废弃物)to the surface that might look like a strange animal.
However, none of these is identified.
44．According to the skeptics, which of the following is TRUE?
A.It is impossible for a monster to live in cold water.
B.The Loch Ness Monster often stays under the water.
C.The Loch Ness Monster is an air-breathing animal.
D.There is no so-called monster in Loch Ness.
45．The purpose of setting up the Loch Ness Investigation Bureau is to 　　　.
A.research the plesiosaur in the Loch Ness
B.protect the Nessie in the lake
C.collect some information about the Nessie
D.catch the Loch Ness Monster
46．Which of the following is the correct order for the things that happened in the passage?
a. A young student met with a monster crossing the road.
b. A swimmer was attacked by a monster in Loch Ness.
c. A new road was built along the edge of the Loch.
d. The Loch Ness Investigation Bureau was set up.
e. Three fishermen saw a creature swimming towards their boat.
A.b, e, c, a, d	B.a,b, e, d, c	C.b, d, a, c, e	D.d, c, e, b, a
47．We can infer from the passage that 　　　.
A.Nessie is an aquatic type of dinosaur	B.Nessie has a 20-foot-long body
C.Nessie is an underwater wave	D.Nessie is still a mystery
48．What does this passage mainly talk about?
A.The natural scenery of Loch Ness.
B.The Nessie.
C.Skeptics’ opinions on Loch Ness Monster.
D.The Loch Ness Investigation Bureau’s research results.

 
The Age of Unreason
Charles Handy
　　In his book The Age of Unreason Professor Handy describes the dramatic changes that are taking place in our lives today and warns that we must adapt to these changes if we want to survive in the future.
　　Handy believes that in the future less than 50% of the workforce will be employed full-time by an organization. These full-time employees will be the qualified professionals, technicians, and managers who are essential to an organization. Their working lives will be a lot more demanding than today, but in return they will be well-paid and they will retire earlier. The rest of the workforce will be self-employed or will work part-time, providing organizations with the products and services they require on a contract basis. Handy forecasts a big increase in the number of working mothers in the future and believes there will be a large number of unemployed.
　　Handy gives us plenty of figures to worry about. He estimates that by the year 2040, one person in five will retire, and one in ten will be over seventy-five years old. There will be one retiree to every three people of working age, and even more than that in countries such as Germany and Switzerland, where the proportion will be as much as one to two. Retirees will remain healthy and active for longer than they do today and many will live to be a hundred years old, a fact which leads Handy to suggest that the term retirement will no longer be appropriate. He suggests the third age is a more appropriate description, since it will be as important a part of our lives as the first age of learning and the second age of working are for us today.
49．Professor Handy wrote the book most probably to　　　. 
A.warn us of potential social problems in the future
B.predict the leading professions in the coming years
C.describe the effect of unemployment on society
D.suggest a better term for future retirement
50．According to Professor Handy, the future workforce will　　　. 
A.adapt to the changes in retirement easily
B.be mainly self-employed
C.have fewer full-time workers than today
D.work on a contract basis
51．From the last paragraph, we learn that about 30 years from now,　　　. 
A.the number of retirees will double in many countries
B.ageing will be a common and serious problem
C.10% of the population will live to be 100 years old
D.the third age will be the most important part of our lives
 
My grandfather died more than twenty-five years ago. I was fifteen. He was kind, strong, fair, and very funny. When I was a young musician, he was my biggest fan. I played my violin for him when he visited, and he loved everything, but each time he had one request. “Could you play ‘Amazing Grace’?” he asked, full of hope and with a twinkle in his eye, because he knew my answer was always, “I don’t know that one!” We went through this routine at every major holiday, and I always figured I’d have time to learn it for him later.
About the time I entered high school and started guitar, Grandpa got cancer. The last time I saw him alive was Thanksgiving weekend in 1985. My mom warned us that Grandpa didn’t look the same anymore and that we should prepare ourselves. For a moment I didn’t recognize him. He looked so small among all the white sheets. We had all gathered in Ohio for the holiday, and I’m sure we all knew we were there to say good-bye. I can see now that Grandpa held on long enough to see us each one more time. I remember how we ate in the dining room and laughed and talked while Grandpa rested in his hospital bed. I wonder if it was sad for him to be alone with our voices and laughter. Knowing Grandpa, he was probably content.
The next morning I found my moment alone with him. I pulled out my guitar, tuned to his appreciative gaze, and finally played for him “Amazing Grace.” I had worked on it for weeks, knowing it never mattered whether I actually played it well and choosing not to believe as I played that it was my last concert for my biggest fan. The cancer had stolen his smile, but I saw joy in his eyes. He held my hand afterward, and I knew I had done something important.
I argued with people all through college about my music major. I was told by strangers that music wouldn’t make me any money and it wasn’t useful like being a doctor. But I know firsthand that with music I was able to give my grandpa something at a point when no one else could.
52．At first the author didn’t play ‘Amazing Grace’ for Grandpa because _________.
A.her grandfather was just joking.	B.she found it difficult to play
C.she disliked playing it.	D.she hadn’t learned it yet
53．From the last sentence in Paragraph 2 we can infer that ____________.
A.Grandpa was too weak to feel anything
B.Grandpa was used to living alone
C.Grandpa treasured love from family
D.Grandpa was optimistic about his health
54．When the author finally played “Amazing Grace” for Grandpa, ____________.
A.she brought him love and comfort
B.she knew she must play it well
C.she made him smile joyfully
D.she believed she could play it many times for him.
55．What is the author’s attitude toward her music major?
A.Disapproving.	B.Positive.	C.Doubtful.	D.Regretful.
 

四、七选五：
The iPod generation
Today it is common to see people who walk about with colored wires hanging from their ears wherever they go. They move about in their personal bubbles, sometimes unaware of what’s happening around them. 　56　Outside life is shut out. So are you one of “them”?
For me, walking around in my own personal bubble is perfect. 　57　What’s even better, wearing earphones seems to give a signal to people which says: “I’m not available for chatting at the moment!”
Suppose you’re at work and about to make an incredible breakthrough, but a colleague suddenly turns up. At this precise moment, the slightest disturbance would break your concentration. 　58　Once again, those wires hanging from your ears would be sure to give that “Go away!” signal.
　59　It’s probably part of the growing up stage when they just want to ignore their whole family. While their mothers give them lectures about why they should do their homework, they can just turn up the volume(声音) on their MP3 player, smile, and say “Yes, Mum.” Problem solved.
Pretty soon, not only will we have pretty colored wires hanging from our ears—but also our brains will be directly plugged into some new high-tech instrument. We’ll be in a virtual(虚拟) world, communicating with everyone else, or choosing not to, as we like. In this world, we will all be permanently plugged in. 　60　And they are changing our social habits along the way.
In the end, there is a thin line between using technology as a tool for making life better and being a slave to it! It’s so strange—suddenly, I don’t feel like wearing my earphones any more!
A.Listening to music through earphones is the perfect way to ignore such interruptions.
B.I also have wires hanging from my ears.
C. They walk around in their own spaces, with their personal “digital noise reduction systems.
D. I don’t have to deal with the noise from the environment.
E. After all, I am listening to my favorite music and would rather not be disturbed.
F. Our instruments are changing quickly.
G. In the home situation, teenagers love these wires.

71.As is vividly shown in the picture, a country boy is crying helplessly in the darkness, longing eagerly for school education. It implies severe educational problems in some rural areas of China. In contrast, the city boy on the right is enjoying all the benefits.
The comparison indicates the educational inequality in modern China. In the countryside, school-age children are often dropping out of school due to poverty. Even those who manage to stay in school are still suffering from the low standards of educational facilities and academic qualities. Comparatively, city children have much better opportunities to receive good education. Thus, schools in the countryside generally have much lower enrollment rates than those in the city, which in turn worsens the problem of educational inequality.
To solve this problem, the government should spend more money on the improvement of education in rural areas. Meanwhile, the media can appeal for public donations for rural education. Moreover, all the people in the community should be aware of the seriousness of the problem and do whatever to help. Only if we do these can we have more social justice and thus make our society more harmonious.

I got up, went to the  39  and dragged the boxes into the room. The garland (花环) was the first to  40 . I took the large ornaments (装饰物) off next. They  41  a large pile on our bed. An hour later, our bed was covered with Christmas memories. 
I prepared the boxes and  42  placed ornaments in their protective packaging, pausing every few minutes to  43  a favorite. “Hey, little Santa!” I held the Santa from my childhood. “Thanks for being my friend for almost fifty years.” He was a little  44  but still gives me a flood of wonderful memories. 
There was a collection of handmade ones my children made in their first years of school more than twenty years ago. They are  45  perfect in design, but every year they go on my memory tree. 
A few hours after I started, the  46  boxes were back in the garage, the room was  47  and I sat staring at the corner. It took me two days of work to  48  my tree, but only a few hours to take it apart.
My tree is a good marriage or a great friendship.  49  the tree, they take a long time to decorate with memories, but can be torn down  50  .What once stood proudly in the glow of love comes tumbling down and all it  51  is an unkind word or a thoughtless act.
Every year I have to put my tree away, but not my marriage or friendships. They get to glow in the corner of my life for  52  I live. I get to analyze my tree and find memories for a few weeks every year. I can do the same with the loves in my life every day. When I held the Santa, a flood of wonderful memories  53  . The same happens when I hold my wife or see the smile of a friend across the room.
54 your friendships and your marriage. Once they come down, they aren’t as easy to put back together as a Christmas tree, if  55 . Stand them in that special spot in the corner of your heart and admire their glow.

Learning to read and write is a complex process, which can be disrupted in various ways, leading to disorders known as dyslexia and dysgraphia（读写障碍）. Two new studies, published in a recent special issue of Elsevier's Cortex provide evidence of this variety, suggesting that effective treatment needs to take it into account.
A group of researchers from the Universities of Bari and Rome in Italy studied the reading and writing abilities of 33 Italian dyslexic children, comparing their performance with that of children with normal reading ability. Italian is an "orthographically transparent" language, meaning that letters tend to correspond to the same sounds, whereas many letters in the English alphabet change their sound from word to word (like the "c" in car and city). However, the new study showed that even in Italian, in which it is relatively straightforward to convert sounds into letters, children still have difficulty in spelling. Younger children with dyslexia generally performed worse than proficient readers; however, the older ones showed a more selective impairment when spelling words, suggesting that knowledge of vocabulary may be more important in spelling than previously thought.
The other study, from Tel Aviv University, Israel, provided the first systematic description of a type of reading disorder called "attentional dyslexia" in which children identify letters correctly, but the letters jump between words on the page, e.g., "kind wing" is read as "wind king". Teachers and neuron-psychologists often notice that children substitute letters when reading, but in this type of dyslexia the substitutions are not caused by inability to identify letters or convert them into sounds; they result from migrations of letters between words. The findings showed that letters would mostly migrate to the same position in another word, so the first letter of one word would switch places with the first letter of another word. Awareness to the existence of this type of dyslexia is important, because it suggests a straightforward way to assist these children in reading —— by presenting a ‎single word at a time, e.g., with the help of a word-sized window cut in a piece of cardboard.
58. We know from the first new study that __________.
A. Italian is easier to learn in comparison with English 
B. knowledge of vocabulary has a close link with spelling
C. in Italian each letter has only one correspondent sound  
D. children with normal reading ability have no trouble in converting letters into sounds
59. As is inferred from the passage, ___________.
A. many people cannot distinguish learning to read and learning to write
B. converting letters into sounds is more difficult than the other way round 
C. younger children usually have a poorer knowledge of vocabulary
D. in the past not enough attention is paid to knowledge of vocabulary
60. In “attentional dyslexia”, children ___________.
A. do not pay enough attention to the meaning of each word
B. are not capable of telling letters apart
C. can not change letters into sounds accordingly 
D. tend to transfer the first letter from one word to another

Marc had worked in the city hall’s engineering department for so long that the city was laid out in his mind like a map，full of names and places．And then something happened that filled him with shock．    
One August afternoon，he discovered a card saying GREEN BOTTLE STREET at the back of the drawer．He checked the listed details．It was not there．It was a lost，a forgotten street，which existed in the heart of Montreal，not half a mile from city hall，and no one had known．He put the card in his pocket and the next day he went looking for the street with beating heart．    
At his first glance，Marc realized how it had gotten its unusual name．It was exactly like a bottle in shape．With the sun shining on the garden plots，and the blue sky overhead，the street gave him a sense of peace．A woman some sixty years of age was watering roses in the garden of the first house to his right．    
He announced，“I'm from the city engineering department，madam．”    
The woman recovered herself and set her watering can down．    
“So you have found out at last,” she said．“We paid our taxes and made out a lot of forms and answered the questions of various officials．Then，after a while, we were sent no notices，so we paid no more taxes．No one bothered us at all．It was a long time before we understood that in some way they’d forgotten about us．”    
Marc nodded．Of course，if Green Bottle Street had been ignored by the city hall，no inspectors would go there，no tax collectors．All would pass merrily by．    
“For several years，the tenants(租户) here had lived in harmony with each other and the landlord．The owner became so attached to them that he gave them all he had when he died．I have lived here for more than twenty years．I hope to end my days here as well．”    
She smiled pleasantly at him，apparently forgetting for the moment that he carried in his pocket a bomb that could blow their little world to pieces．  
“You remind me of my nephew,” she said suddenly．“He was a dear boy．I was heart broken when he died．I’m the last of my family, you know．”    
Marc thought of his noisy and violent landlady and neighbors．He could not recall when he had been spoken to with such simple goodwill．His heart warmed to this old lady．“I wonder, ”he said slowly, “I am a good tenant，and I wonder…”    
“Oh yes，”she leaned forward eagerly, “you could have the top floor of my house．I'm sure it would suit you．”    
Marc took the card out of his pocket and tore it across and dropped the pieces in the watering can．As far as he was concerned，Green Bottle Street would remain mislaid forever．
61. The underlined sentence “So you’ve found out at last” shows that the woman was        .   
A. disappointed      B. puzzled      C. curious      D. excited
62. It can be inferred that Marc        .   
A. carried a bomb in his pocket         
B. hated inspectors and tax collectors    
C. looked for the long-lost street happily  
D. would probably move to Green Bottle Street
63. Marc tore the card into pieces mainly because        .   
   A. he fell in love with the woman        
B. Green Bottle Street got mislaid    
C. it presented the wrong information     
D. he treasured the peace in Green Bottle Street
64. From the passage we may know that        .    
A. the woman’s nephew resembled Marc a lot    
B. the woman was attached to where she lived    
C. tenants in Green Bottle Street often had conflicts    
D. Marc’s landlord gave away what he had when he died

The word tolerance is widely used in liberal democracies. It indicates a positive meaning. Politicians urge us to be tolerant towards minorities. Educators teach us to be tolerant towards the other. The press is full of references to the need to display tolerance when faced with individuals or groups espousing a different view or holding a different religious belief. A tolerant society is an objective sought after by anyone who believes in the values of democracy. A tolerant individual is attributed with virtuous qualities.
The question we must ask is whether we have been using the word tolerance fully aware of its meaning and whether we have applied it correctly to reflect what we really wish to convey?
The word tolerance means to bear, or to bear with. If I tolerate something or someone, I basically say that I am ready to bear it or him. I can tolerate a bad smell or a noisy neighbour. The act of toleration forces me to desist from conveying my objection to the existence of a phenomenon, which I find difficult to bear. A bad smell or a noisy neighbour is considered by me to be an objectionable phenomenon. By tolerating either of them, I am not transforming the bad smell or the noisy neighbour into positive phenomena. Let's be honest: I don't have a different taste when it comes to bad smells. I simply dislike it and wish that it disappears. I don't respect the noisy neighbour. I would rather have him stop at once the noise he is making so I can live in peace. 
To try to remove the bad smell or take reasonable action in order for the noisy neighbour to stop bothering me would most probably not be considered an intolerant act by most people.
Now, let's try to apply the word tolerance in reference to a person who is law-abiding and holds a legally acceptable different view from my own. I may have a strong view, which is opposed to his. Quite frankly, I may decide to tolerate his view. By so doing, I would be attributing to it a negative characteristic. I would apply the same attitude to his view as to the bad smell or noisy neighbour. Thus, to try to take action in order to make his view disappear would be considered an intolerant act. To tolerate his view the way I would a bad smell or a noisy neighbour, could hardly be considered virtuous.
The subject tolerating is by nature not equal to the object being tolerated. If I tolerate you, I essentially say that I am above you and am prepared, although unwillingly, to bear with your presence or with your practices or opinions. That may be true in the case of an individual who is ready to tolerate the other. However, this attitude by such an individual, though empirically true, is hardly a virtue. Certainly, the fact that an individual, in reality, may merely tolerate the other or his opinion does not justify a government or any official authority promoting tolerance as a virtue. One cannot tolerate an equal being. True equality involves respect, not toleration. To respect the other as a distinctive person is hardly to tolerate him. This is the true meaning of equality: diversity existing in a mutually-respectful socio-legal setting. 
 The danger with tolerance is that it can lead to the acceptance of individuals or groups bent on destroying the foundations of democratic systems. We have seen such cases with regard to political parties or destructive religious groups that have been treated in a liberal manner under the guise of tolerance. 
 A tolerant attitude involves the grant of a favour, not a right. The question we should ask ourselves is whether we would ever wish a parliament to make laws according to us, as individuals and as part of a collective entity or a permission to pursue certain actions interpreted as a favour rather than a right? Indeed, would we ever wish anyone to listen to our views and accept us the way we are simply because he is kind enough to tolerate us?
65. The first two paragraphs are mainly intended to show that __________.
A. tolerance is a symbol of liberal democracies
B. democratic society always advocates tolerance
C. people’s understanding of tolerance is one-sided
D. tolerance can be applied to many situations
66. The underlined part “desist from” in Paragraph 3 can be replaced by “________’.
	A. deny  			B. dislike  			C. stop 				D. keep 
67. The example of a bad smell and a noisy neighbour is raised to indicate that _________.
	A. the writer are fed up with them 
	B. most people find them hard to tolerate 
C. the writer isn’t prejudiced against them 
D. tolerating them isn’t a virtuous act
68. The main idea of Paragraph 6 is that _________.
	A. tolerance has nothing to do with respect 
	B. most people promote tolerance as a virtue 
	C. people should show respect for each other 
	D. tolerance shows an unequal relationship
69. Which of the following will the writer probably agree with?
	A. Too much tolerance will endanger the foundations of democratic systems.
	B. By tolerating people can transform something negative into the opposite.
	C. People tolerating others are likely to consider them as their equals.
D. Being tolerant should be regarded as a right instead of a favour
70. The best title for this passage should be “___________”.
A. Tolerance and respect						B. What is to be tolerated?
C. Is Tolerance a Virtue?						D. Should people be tolerant?

请认真阅读下列短文，并根据所读内容在文章后表格中的空格里填入一个最恰当的单词。注意：每个空格只填1个单词。请将答案写在答题卡上相应题号的横线上。
Chronic disorganization （慢性失序症）occurs when one has a habit of being disorganized over a long period, which means the person is constantly unsystematic in how he conducts life and business. One suffering from this problem may find relief in the fact that it isn’t actually a disease or even an “ official” disorder. It’s the continued lack of organization in one’s life.
Someone may become addicted to collecting a certain thing yet never organize the collection as it grows out of control. This can especially be a problem for those with a lot of time and money at hand, yet the problem can be serious for any type of person in a wide variety of situation.
One’s personal attitude can often be a big part of why the chronic disorganization exists. Once the attitude of acceptance about being a “slob” is in someone’s head, it’s hard to remove. If someone tells himself that he is a slob, he will likely live up to that self-image created by him or by those around him.
One first receives true awareness of the disorder of chronic disorganization when it starts to negatively affect relationships with friends and family members. Everybody becomes affected by this situation, especially those sharing living places with the one involved.
The National Study Group for Chronic Disorganization (HSGCD) recommends that one get help through a professional organizer. The study found that all of the subjects in the study had problems with making decisions. There were varied reasons given for this problem of decision-making. Among them were fears and prioritizing issues. Research is ongoing for the link between problems in decision-making and chronic disorganization.
Chronic disorganization often begins with situational disorganization, something most people experience at some point. Someone who has lost someone significant to him may start to be troubled by disorganization after a divorce. Someone who experienced changes in life and in his career is likely to let things like organization and order fall by the wayside. However, one doesn’t instantly have chronic disorganization.
“ If you’re going through hell, keep going.” That’s an old saying that’s true about one’s struggles with chronic disorganization. Every person has the power to change within himself. It’s a matter of staying organized, one day at a time. Those who have left chronic disorganization in the past have often done so by promising to stay organized simply for that single day. 

Definition
◆It means that the person is 71____▲______ disorganized in life and business over a long period. 72____▲______ of organization , one is likely to have the problem.

problem
◆One example is that an addict is73 ____▲_______ to organize the collection.

◆People losing someone significant, going through a divorce or changes in one’s life and career have a 79 _____▲________to ignore organization and order.

As the diagram shows, vehicles, coal-burning, airborne dust, mobile sources and industrial production are the major pollution sources in Chinese cities, which have damaged our life, environment and even the future development. 
Various forms of pollution, including air pollution, noise pollution, and water pollution, have increased with the fast development of Chinese cities, which has caused many problems and concerns. With the development of modern industry and expansion of urbanization, pollution is becoming more and more serious.
Measures must be taken to balance city development and environmental protection. First of all, our government should make more strict laws to limit the use of private cars. What’s more, we are supposed to raise our awareness of environmental protection and push for the use of alternative energy, such as solar energy and wind energy. Only by applying sustainable development can we have a better world to live in. （150words）

M: Last week, madam? I can’t remember which ones you mean. What were they like?
W: Oh, they were lovely! Sort of imitation wood, dark brown color, country-style, you know, and if I remember correctly, they had a sort of leaf pattern, or was it a flower pattern?
M: That’s strange. I don’t recognize any of the ones we had from that description. Are you sure they were in this shop?
W: Well, you must know the ones I mean. They were on sale, a real bargain, reduced to a quarter of the original price. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw them.
M: I’m afraid the sales are over now, madam, and I know we sold out of all the saucepans.
W: I don’t think you did, actually. At least, my neighbor, Mrs. Cliffe, told me she saw some here only yesterday.
M: Well, it’s all new stock in the window now.
W: May I have a look, to see if there’s anything else?
M: Uh, well, madam, as you know, we were just closing. And perhaps, madam, if you come tomorrow, I could show you everything we have in our range of kitchenware. And there are still one or two things on sale...
W: Oh, look! That one there! That’s the sort of thing I was looking for!

One day last summer I was traveling on the London Underground, on the Piccadilly Line. We stopped at Green Park and a few people got on. Among them were an elderly lady and an elderly gentleman, maybe her husband. Actually, he didn’t quite get on the train because the automatic doors closed on him as he was getting on. I know from experience that this isn’t really a problem — you just push your arms out and the doors move back. However, this couple appeared to be unfamiliar with the underground and this man did the worst thing possible — he stepped back but somehow leaned forward. This meant that the doors closed on his neck so his head was inside the train and the rest of his body was outside. He had a most peculiar expression on his face and he was waving his arms up and down. His wife, who had found a seat, didn’t seem to be the least disturbed. I realized that there was a real danger that he might be dragged along the platform and seriously injured, so I leapt from my seat and, along with two other men, pulled at the doors, which soon sprang back. Nobody else did anything, apart from one person who said, “Pull the communication button” but remained seated. The man took his seat next to his wife. They were both completely calm and didn’t say a word.

第二部分：阅读理解（共两节， 满分40分）
第一节（共15小题；每小题2分，满分30分）
阅读下列短文，从每题所给的四个选项（A、B、C和D）中，选出最佳选项，并在答题卡上将该项涂黑。
A
Now that American education has entered the era of the MOOC—the Massive Open Online Course-the opportunity for cheating appears greater than ever. The all-knowing Google search engine is never more than a few keystrokes away. So how can a teacher manage such a large number of examinees so far away, let alone searching out cheaters taking tests across the Internet?
Using technology, of course. While special services via webcam(摄像头)and cheating detecting software have been developed now, Mettl, an online company, has developed advanced techniques for netting cheaters, which the company claims are even more reliable and easier to use. Whatever small attempt to cheat, he or she will be found out.
Mettl has adopted a handful of technologies on its test—taking platform, creating a mini monitoring state in an exam. Here’s how it works：A test-taker signs on to Mettl and selects his／her exam from the site’s library of pre—loaded tests. Facial and keystroke recognition technology confirm the person that has signed in is the very person, and the system records both the test—taker(through the webcam)and the test—taker’s screen throughout the test.
Mettl’s technology uses the test—taker’s webcam to detect how many people are using the computer. Soon, it will track eye movement well enough to sense whether the test-taker is looking away from the screen, perhaps to Consult a smart phone or a friend in secret. Mettl also monitors the test-taker’s screen and can detect when the test-taker has changed a computer or moved from the test. The system will soon be able to record sound, thus detecting whether the test-taker is talking or being talked to.
    If any irregularities are detected, the system flags the incident and reports it back to the test’s administrator. This can bring any number of things, depending on the test-giver’s wishes：a complete shutdown of the exam, a warning message that appears on the test-taker’s screen, even human instructions from the control center.
    Mettl is hoping its technology will help it break into the country’s big MOOC markets.
21. What’s the best title of the passage?
  A. Advantages of Massive Open Online Courses
  B. Using technology to fight against cheating online
  C. A new Test system serving the online students
  D. How Americans help increase educational opportunity
22. From the first paragraph we can infer that         
A. MOOC has replaced the traditional form of education
B. Teachers should be more strict in dealing with cheating
C. Google is a software designed for cheating
D. Preventing online cheating is a tougher job
23. How can Mettl help to get rid of cheating online?
A. By equipping teachers with cameras.
B. By asking test-takers to sign in.
C. By providing different tests at the same time.
D. By recording the test-takers’ behaviors.
24. Which part of a newspaper does the article come from?
A. Health    B. Education    C .Entertainment   D. Culture

The hottest TV drama in China – “Nirvana in Fire” or “Langya Bang” has just ended. Millions of people waited every day after midnight for the latest (two) episodes. Are you one of them? What is the story about? Why the show is so popular?
　　“Nirvana in Fire” is based on an Internet novel by author Hai Yan, who was invited to pen the screenplay for the television adaptation. The 55-episode series, set in a fictionalized kingdom, weaves together two storylines — one about a betrayed general's revenge and the other about princes fighting for the throne.
　The series was put on screen on Sep. 19th, and the number of Internet views exceeded 140 million times the next day. Only during the week of National holiday, the number increased by 1.6 billion.
　　It’s now the hottest Chinese TV show with a very high score of 9.3 on Douban. (The classical TV drama, Journey to the West, produced in 1986 is with the same score). Previous and recent costume dramas such as “The Journey of Flower” and “Yun Zhong Ge” only scored 6.4 and 3.5.
　　Drawing comparisons to “The Count of Monte Cristo”, the story revolves around a gifted young man named Lin Shu, whose father serves as a general. Already a high-ranking military officer by his teenager years, Lin Shu enjoyed a close friendship with Prince Xiao Jingyan and was even engaged to Princess Nihuang.
　　At age 17, however, Lin Shu’s life turned upside down when his father’s army was framed and destroyed by a foxy political rival. Lin Shu escaped death, but due to the poisoning, his body became weak and frail, and he lost his martial arts abilities. From then on, his face was pale and his fingers always ice-cold.
　　After twelve years, Lin Shu returned to his country’s capital with a new name, Mei Changsu, and a new identity, the leader of the Jiang Zuo Alliance. He then became the strategic adviser for his friend, Prince Jingyan, who had been exiled(流放) by the king. Despite the efforts of Prince Xiao Jingheng and the crown prince to win the throne for themselves, Mei Changsu succeeds in paving the road for his friend to take over as king, as well as the avenging the injustices dealt to his troops many years before.


25. Which of the following is true?
  A. Lin Shu changed his face and name in order to take revenge.
  B. Lin Shu and the crown prince were childhood friends and Lin helped him to be the king.
  C. Nirvana in Fire was set in a real kingdom in history.
  D. Nirvana in Fire shares the same score with Journey to the West on Douban.
26. What is the underlined word mean?
  A. made a false charge      B. taken advantage of   C. defeated     D. got ride of 
27. What is more likely to talk about in the following paragraph?
  A. How did the prince fight for the throne?
  B. Where was Nirvana in Fire shot?
  C. Why did Nirvana in Fire enjoy such popularity?
  D. What happened to Mei Changshu after he succeeded in taking the revenge?
C
Even when you’re extremely busy, you aren’t using your time with 100% efficiency. There are gaps in everyone’s schedule where they aren’t doing anything important. Even if your schedule has no gaps, there is probably lots of time where you aren’t working as fast or as effectively as you possibly could.
Why aren’t you completely efficient? It’s because time isn’t the limiting factor. If it were the limiting factor, people could work non-stop without breaks or any unproductive distractions. Instead, people, even those who are highly productive, need to take breaks, occasionally procrastinate(拖延) and slow down on tasks throughout the day.
The real and most important limiting factor for productivity is your energy levels to pay attention. Energy levels limit your productivity because when you’re tired, you can have ample time and still not get everything done. Your attention ability is also limited, because even if there are a million things that need to be done, you can only focus on one or two at a time.
You might not be able to insert another 4-5 hours into your schedule without making some sacrifices. But even extremely busy people can add an hour or two into their schedule without cancelling anything. The reason it’s hard to “find time” isn’t a lack of time. It’s because you don’t have enough energy left to focus on something else that needs to fit into your day.
I first suspected time wasn’t the real problem during an extremely busy period in my life over a year ago. I was insanely busy, but at that time I still exercised regularly. I had daily-to-do lists with over twenty items, and I still found time to exercise. However, after a few weeks off, due to illness, stopped exercising. I was not busy by any standards, in fact, my schedule was incredibly light. Despite this free time, I found it hard to find time to exercise. It seemed to get pushed later and later into my schedule until it was gone. How can I explain this odd experience? I believe you have known it.
28. If someone can’t work with 100% efficiency, the most important limiting factor is ______.
  A. a schedule without gaps         	 B. breaks and distractions	
  C. the limited time                	 D. the limited energy
29. According to paragraph 4, everyone, including the extremely busy people, can ______.
  A. work without any rest           	  B. focus on many things at a time
  C. find some more time in a day     	D. do some exercise regularly
30. After a few weeks off, what was the change of the writer’s life?
  A. He had a longer daily to-do lists with over twenty items.
  B. He stopped doing exercise because of the lack of energy.
  C. He found it hard to find time to exercise because he was busier.
  D. He pushed most of the things later and later in his schedule.
31.The writer gives the example of himself in the last paragraph in order to ___________.
  A. prove what the real limiting factor is       B. show us how busily he needs to work
  C. explain how important a healthy body is    D. tell us what an odd experience he has
D
A Dutch artist and designer has come up with a device which he hopes will get rid of pollutants from Beijing's smog skies, creating clean air for the city's mask-wearing people.
An electromagnetic field（电磁场） will pull particles（微粒） in the smog to the ground where they can be easily cleaned.
“It's like when you have a balloon which has static（静电） and your hair goes toward it. Same with the smog,” says artist Daan Roosegaarde.
His studio has reached an agreement with the Beijing government to test the technology in one of tile capital's parks.
With its skies regularly covered by dirty gray smog, Beijing this week announced a series of emergency measures to handle the problem.
 Roosegaarde says an indoor model device has already proven it works and is confident that the results — with the help of a team of scientists and engineers — can be replicated outside.
“Beijing is quite a good place because the smog in Beijing is quite low. It lies in a valley so there's not so much wind. It's a good environment to explore this kind of thing.”
 “We'll be able to purify the air and the challenge is to get the top of the smog so you can see the sun again.”
 Roosegaarde acknowledges that projects like this are a way of drawing attention to the problem, rather than a practical solution to Beijing's awful air pollution.
“This is not the real answer for smog. The real answer has to do with clean cars, different industry and different lifestyles.”
However, he hopes the project will make a “fundamental statement” by allowing the city's people to realize the difference between breathing clean and smog-filled air.
32. The device works by _______.
  A. helping keep the particles out with more masks
  B. pulling pollutants to the ground with an electromagnetic field
  C. absorbing hair with a balloon with static
  D. creating clean air and let it out into the sky
33. According to the passage, ______ .
  A. the Beijing government has agreed to use the technology in Beijing
  B. they have proven the results of the device both indoors and outdoors
  C. the results of the air-cleaning device can be expectable
  D. the Beijing government has never done anything to handle the air pollution

34. What does Roosegaarde really mean by saying “Beijing is quite a good place…... ”?
  A. The air pollution in Beijing is not quite serious.
  B. The weather in Beijing is good for foreigners to live in.
  C. Beijing is quite fit for using the air-cleaning device.
  D. It is easy to get the top of the smog in Beijing.
35. Roosegaarde appeals to people in Beijing to ________.
  A. pay attention to air pollution and solve the problem finally
  B. invent more devices to clean the smog in Beijing
  C. drive modern cars and try different lifestyles
  D. realize how serious the pollution they're facing is

 We’d better develop our interest in English at the beginning of our study.   36   We may feel good when we can say something simple in English.
  37   So we must make some plans before study. And we should certainly carry out these plans in our study.
  38   Our notes are much thinner than the books so that we can learn them by heart easily and can often review and read them. We may also record our notes on tapes so as to listen to them easily.
Reading a newspaper is the best thing to improve your English.   39   It will help you keep in touch with a lot of subjects in English.
  40   Learn by heart the whole sentences and the phrases that contain the new words so that we may know how to use the words.
If time permits, we may read a mini Chinese-English dictionary carefully from cover to cover, which may help us widen our sight and master knowledge in all ways.

A. Read a little from a newspaper every day.
B. Don’t read books without making notes. 
C. Carefully write an e-mail in English.
D. It’s easy to develop an interest in English study. 
E. The more, the better.
F. Plans are always very necessary.
G. Never just memorize single English words.

As an archaeology student, I already knew/have known something about the Qin Tomb and the terracotta warriors. Most Chinese children can tell you Qin Shihuang was the emperor ^who first unified China. He was a brilliant ruler, but he was also a cruel man who killed thousands of people.

第一节：共10小题，每小题2分，满分20分
A
When traveling, it’s important to learn about the customs and etiquette（礼仪） of the global village. What we consider polite behavior at home isn't always accepted outside our borders. 
    • Etiquette of Gift Giving
Gift giving should be a happy, positive experience. When selecting a present for someone in Netherlands, don't purchase fancy kitchen knives or scissors. Giving sharp, pointy objects as gifts is considered unlucky. Be careful when presenting flowers to a friend or a business partner in Russia. Yellow blooms suggest cheat or a relationship break up. Traditionally, red carnations are placed on the tombs of the dead. Writing cards or notes while visiting South Korea, be mindful of your pen's ink color. Writing a person's name in red ink traditionally suggests that the person has passed away－an important point to remember when giving a birthday card.
    • Eating Customs
Being early or on time is viewed as being rude, too eager or even greedy in Venezuela. If you are invited to someone's home for a meal, it's recommended that you arrive 10 minutes later than the requested time. When having a meal in Egypt, don’t use the salt shaker (盐瓶). It's insulting to your host to spread salt on your food, which means that you find the meal terrible. Japan is a very polite nation, and their fondness for etiquette extends to the use of chopsticks. According to Japanese custom, if you're in the middle of eating, use the opposite end of your chopsticks to secure food from a shared plate. When doing business in Turkey, it’s the custom for your host to pay for your meal. Requests to split the bill won’t be accepted. If you would like to pay your fair share, Turks recommend inviting your host to a follow-up meal. 
21. Which of the following is true according to the passage?
A. Giving a fancy kitchen knife to a friend from Russia is a good choice.
B. You can use blue ink to write notes to your friend from South Korea.
C. Dining with Japanese, one can use either end of the chopsticks to get food from shared plates.
D. Invited to a meal, one should arrive earlier to show respect for the host.
22. What does the underlined word “insulting” in Paragraph 3 refer to?
A. Respectful.	B. Challenging.		C. Indifferent.		D. Offensive.
23. Where is this passage probably from?
A. A news report.					B. A travel essay.
C. A culture column.				D. A food magazine.
B
Individuality is the particular character, or aggregate (total) of qualities that distinguishes one person or thing from others. Many artists late in the last century were in search of a means to express their individuality. Modern dance was one of the ways some of these people sought to free their creative spirit. At the beginning there was no exacting technique, no foundation from which to build. In later years, trial, error and genius founded the techniques and the principles of the movement. Eventually, innovators (改革者) even drew from what they considered the dread （令人恐惧的）ballet, but first they had to get rid of all that was academic so that the new could be discovered. The beginnings of modern dance were happening before Isadora Duncan, but she was the first person to bring the new dance to general audiences and see it accepted and acclaimed (称赞).
 Her search for a natural movement form sent her to nature. She believed movement should be as natural as the swaying of the trees and the rolling waves of the sea, and should be in harmony with the movements of the Earth. Her great contributions are in three areas.
 First, she began the expansion of the kinds of movement that could be used in dance. Before Duncan danced, ballet was the only type of dance performed in concert. In the ballet the feet and legs were emphasized, with virtuosity (高超技巧) shown by complex, codified positions and movements. Duncan performed dance by using her body in the freest possible way. Her dance stemmed from her soul and spirit. She was one of the pioneers who broke tradition so others might be able to develop the art.
 Her second contribution lies in dance costume. She rejected ballet shoes and stiff costumes. These were replaced with flowing Grecian (希腊式的) tunes, bare feet, and unbound hair. She believed in the natural body being allowed to move freely, and her dress displayed this ideal.
Her third contribution was in the use of music. In her performances she used the symphonies of great masters including Beethoven and Wagner, which was not the usual custom.
She was as exciting and eccentric (怪异) in her personal life as in her dance.
24．According to the passage, what did nature represent to Isadora Duncan?
A．Something to conquer.     		B．A model for movement.  
C．A place to find peace.   			D．A symbol of disorder.
25．Compared to those of the ballet, Isadora Duncan’s costumes were less _______.
A．costly          B．colorful   	C．graceful      D．restrictive
26. We can infer from the passage that the author _________.
A. appreciates modern dance very much   B. dislikes Isadora Duncan’s dance
C. thinks highly of individuality          D. knows a lot about modern arts
27. Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?
A．Artists of the Last Century    	B．Evolution of Dance in the 20th Century
C．Natural Movement in Dance   D．A Pioneer in Modern Dance
C
Since Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay climbed Mount Everest, Mount Qomolangma’s peak is no longer a lonely place and is turning into a trash heap（垃圾堆）. 
So far, more than 350 climbers have successfully reached the peak. And they have complained about waiting for hours in the bottlenecks (狭窄路段) on the way to the peak, a situation that isn’t just uncomfortable — it’s cold and windy up there — but downright dangerous. If bad weather strikes, climbers can and do die.
As a matter of fact, the dangerous crowds aren’t the only problem on Qomolangma. All those climbers need to bring a lot of gear—and much of them ends up being left on the mountain, sometimes even the peak itself. Mount Qomolangma is becoming the world’s largest dump. Here’s mountaineer Mark Jenkins writing in National Geographic about the state of Qomolangma: “The two standard routes, the Northeast Ridge and the Southeast Ridge, are disgustingly polluted with oxygen cans and torn tents everywhere.”
But the good news is that some mountaineers are taking it upon themselves to clean up Qomolangma. Mountianeer Paul Thelen and his friend Eberhard Schaaf are part of the annual Eco Everest Expedition, which has been cleaning up rubbish from base camps to the peak since 2008. So far they’ve collected over 13 tons of garbage.
Some of that rubbish is even being used for a higher purpose. As part of the Mount Everest 8844 Art Project, a group of 15 artists from Nepal collected 1.5 tons of garbage brought down the mountain by climbers. They’ve transformed the cans and oxygen tanks—and in one case, part of the remains of a helicopter—into 74 pieces of art that have already gone on exhibition in Nepal’s capital. Part of the profit from sales will go to the Everest Peakers Association, which has helped collect tons of rubbish on the slopes of the mountain. 
28. What do we learn about the bottlenecks on the way to Mount Qomolangma’s peak?
 	A. They are relatively safe.    		B. They are often crowded.   
 	C. They are very easy to pass.   		D. They are sites of base camps.
29. What does the underlined word “gear” mean?  
  	A. Equipment for climbing mountains. 
B. The food climbers brought onto the mountain.  
C. Some important machines used for the bottlenecks.  
D. Some rubbish found on the mountain.
30. The group of 15 Nepali artists_________.
    A. created works of art using rubbish from Qomolangma  
B. were employed by the Everest Peakeers Association  
C. climbed Qomolangma and collected 1.5 tons of trash  
D. painted 74 beautiful pictures of Mount Qomolangma’s peak
31. What can be the best title for the text?  
    A.  Eco Everest Expedition Proves Successful       	
B. Qomolangma Has Become A Huge Mess
C. Test Yourself Against Qomolangma
D. Recycle Rubbish On Qomolangma
D
Students from Florida International University in Miami walked on water Thursday for a class assignment. To do it, they wore aquatic (水上的）shoes they designed and created.
Alex Quinones was the first to make it to the other side of a 175-foot lake on campus in record time—just over a minute. Quinones, who wore oversized boat-like shoes，also won last year and will receive $ 500. Students had to wear the aquatic shoes and make it across the lake in order to earn an “A” on the assignment for Architecture Professor Jaime Canaves, Materials and Methods Construction Class. “It's traditional in a school of architecture to do boats out of cardboard for a boat race. I thought our students were a little bit more special than that,” Canaves said. “We decided to do the walk on water event to take it to the next level.”
A total of 79 students competed in the race this year in 41 teams. Only 10 teams failed to cross the lake. Others who fell got back up and made it to the end. The race is open to all students and anyone in the community. The youngest person to ever participate was a 9-year-old girl who competed in place of her mother, while the oldest was a 67-year-old female.
A large crowd on campus joined Canaves as he cheered on the racers. He shouted encouraging words, but also laughed as some unsteadily made their way to the end.
“A part of this is for them to have more understanding of designing and make it work better,” he said. It is also a lesson in life for the students.
“Anything, including walking on water, is possible, if you do the research，test it and go through the design process seriously.”
32. For what purpose did the students take part in the race?
A. To go across the lake to school.			
B. To test their balance on the water.
C. To pass Professor Canaves’ class.			
D. To win the prize money of $ 500.
33. Which of the following statements is true according to the passage?
A. The students wore shoes distributed by Professor Canaves to walk across the lake.
B. The students who fell into the water were criticized seriously by the Professor.
C. Most students finished the class assignment successfully.
D. The students took part in the race to challenge their physical abilities.
34. What can we infer from the passage?
A. Alex Quinones is a top student in the university.
B. It’s a custom for the people in the community to get involved in student activities.
C. The student who made it to the end in the race would succeed in their professional career.
D. Professor Canaves attaches importance to hands-on learning experience.
35. The purpose of the passage is to ___________. 
A. show his approval of the unique teaching style			
B. report an interesting assignment
C. inspire teachers to be more creative		
D. encourage more people to take part in the race

第二节  阅读填空（共5小题，每小题2分，满分10分）. 根据短文内容，从短文后的选项中选出能填入空白处的最佳选项（选项有两处为多余选项）
Of the many unpleasant emotions we can experience, fear may top the list.    36   . Fear can also keep us from pursuing the things in life that really matter -- like following our dreams, and developing important relationships. I have some ideas, though, of how to be free from fear.
    • Experience fear.
I used to be very afraid of speaking in front of people. I would get sweaty palms and my stomach would be so tied up that I wouldn't be able to eat. However, each time I spoke, I noticed afterwards that it wasn't that bad. Things I fear are never as bad in reality as I make them out in my mind.    37   .
    • Create space.
The first and most important step to being fearless is to create some space between ourselves and the emotion of fear. This isn't accomplished by ignoring the fear, or trying to talk ourselves out of it.    38   . In fact, a recent research shows that by simply admitting the emotion we actually begin to reverse the "fight or flight(逃避)" response in the body.
    • Control the breath and feel the fear.
Once we acknowledge the presence of fear, the second step is to control the breathing so that it becomes slower and gentler. We try to make the breath just a little bit longer, and feel how fear manifests(展现) in the body.    39   . 
With practice, we can create enough space between us and the emotion of fear so that we're able to replace a fearful thought with a positive one.    40   . For instance, before I get up to speak in front of a group of people, I imagine that the audience is positively impressed by what I say and that I manage to complete the speech successfully.

    A. Space is created only when we can honestly acknowledge that fear exists.
    B. We can imagine a positive outcome for whatever we're about to do.
    C. Fear, if left uncontrolled, can even destroy our life.
    D. So one way to get rid of fear is to simply push ourselves to do things that we fear.	
    E. When we can see a positive outcome in our mind, fear no longer holds us back.
    F. But fear is more than just physically unpleasant. 
    G. As we pay attention to the physical symptoms of fear, we can see fear objectively.

阅读下列短文 ，从每题所给的四个选项（A、B、C和D）中 ，选出最佳选项
A
When I was a boy my father told me that he could do anything he wanted to．Dad said that he wanted to be the first to develop color prints in our city．and so he did．  	
When I was 16，dad looked closely at the violin I played and said that he wanted to make one．He read about violinmaking，and then became a violinmaker at the age of 43．He bought the tools and materials，opened a small store and set Mom up as the shopkeeper，while he worked at a local company．He retired from the company 17 years later and continued to make violins and other instruments．  	
Dad often guessed why the Stradivarius violins sounded so beautiful．Some experts told him that it was the special varnish(油漆)that gave the instruments their beautiful sound．Dad argued that chemists could analyze the varnish—if that was the answer．

A supermarket checkout operator was praised for striking a blow for modern manners and a return to the age of politeness after refusing to serve a shopper who was talking on her mobile phone.
The supermarket manager was forced to apologize to the customer who complained she was told her goods would not be scanned unless she hung up her phone. Jo Clark, 46, said, “I don't know what she was playing at. I couldn’t believe how rude she was. When did she have the right to give me a lecture on checkout manners? I won’t be shopping there again!”
But users of social media sites and Internet forums(论坛) were very angry that store gave in and the public appeared to be supporting the angry checkout worker. “Perhaps this is a turning point for mobile phone users everywhere. When chatting, keep your eyes on people around you. That includes people trying to serve you, other road users and especially people behind you in the stairs,” said a typical post.
“It’s time checkout staff fought back against these people constantly chatting on their phones. They can drive anyone crazy. It’s rude and annoying. I often want to grab someone’s phone and throw it as far as I can, even though I am not a checkout girl, just a passer-by,” said another.
Siobhan Freegard, founder of parenting site www. Netmums.com said, “While this checkout operator doesn’t have the authority to order customers to switch off their phones, you can see clearly how frustrated and angry she felt. No matter how busy you are, life is nicer when you and those around you have good manners.”
25．According to Jo Clark, the checkout operator_____________.
A．lacked the knowledge of checkout manners
B．played with a mobile phone while at work
C．had no right to forbid her from using her mobile phone 
D．deserved praise for her modern manners
26．The third and fourth paragraphs imply that the public_________.
A．are used to chatting on their mobile phones
B．are driven crazy by constant mobile calls
C．ignore the existence of mobile phone users
D．seem to support the checkout operator 
27．The attitude of Siobhan Freegard towards the checkout operator was________.
A．disapproving     B．supportive     C．neutral(中立的)      D．indifferent
28．The passage is mainly about _________.
A．whether we should talk on our phones while being served
B．why we can talk on mobile phones while shopping
C．what good manners checkout operators should have
D．how we can develop good manners for mobile phone users

Alibaba started taking the lead in China by connecting big Chinese manufacturers(制造商) with big buyers across the world. Its business-to-business site, Alibaba.com allowed business to buy almost everything. Alibaba’s advantage wasn’t hard to judge: size. Alibaba is just big, even by Chinese standards. Its market attracts 231 million active buyers, 8 million sellers, 11.3 billion orders a year — and Alibaba is just the middleman. It encourages people to use its markets — not charging small sellers a percentage of the sale.    
If you want a quick look into the influence of Alibaba on daily Chinese life, take my experience. I moved to Beijing a year ago and quickly got tired of visiting small stores across the crowded, polluted city of 20 million people in search of new electronics, bathroom furnishings, and anything else my wife wanted. “You’re looking for what exactly? Why not try it? ” my Chinese teacher asked me one day. With that, my wonderful new relationship with Alibaba began.    
Alibaba’s original business-to-business model now is second to consumer buying. Chinese retail(零售) buying makes up 80% of Alibaba’s profit, and leading that group is Taobao, with 800 million items for sale and the most unbelievable selection of things you’ll ever find. TMall.com is Alibaba’s other big site, where you can find brand name goods from Nike and Unilever near the lowest prices.    
What I have a hard time explaining to friends and family back in the U.S. is how China has gone beyond traditional shopping — big-box retailers especially —in favor of online purchases on Taobao and a few other sites. In smaller towns than Beijing, where big retailers have not yet traveled, shopping online is shopping, and shopping is Taobao.
I have a list of some of my recent purchases on Taobao for a sense of how wide the marketplace is. Almost everything arrived a day or two after ordering with free shipping. I’m not even a big buyer, because I need friends to help me search the Chinese-language site. When I was searching my purchase history on my Chinese teacher’s iPad, which helps me buy goods, I looked through with great difficulty about 10 of her purchases for every one of mine.
29．Alibaba’s advantage mainly lies in          .
A．its low price     					  	B．its big size 
C．its not charging small sellers         	D．its business-to-business service  
30．We know from the passage that Alibaba          .
A．will continue to develop. 
B．charges all the sellers on its site a percentage of the sale.
C．acts as a bridge between the buyers and sellers.
D．is of middle size among all the online sites.
31．What can be inferred from the passage?
A．Alibaba’s business-to-business service earns more money than retail. 
B．TMall.com provides more profit than Taobao.
C．Taobao has no obvious advantage over other similar online sites.
D．The author’s Chinese teacher is also an online purchase lover. 
32．What is the passage mainly about?
A．Shopping online in China is TaoBao.
B．How the author purchases online in China.
C．Shopping online goes beyond traditional shopping. 
D．Alibaba influences people’s daily purchase in China.

Although problems are a part of our lives, it certainly doesn’t mean that we let them rule our lives forever. One day or the other, you’ll have to stand up and say – problem, I don’t want you in my life.
   36    Problems with friends, parents, girlfriends, husbands, and children – the list goes on. Apart from these, the inner conflicts within ourselves work, too. These keep adding to our problems. Problems come in different shapes and colors and feelings.
But good news is that all problems can be dealt with. Now read on to know how to solve your problems.
Talk, it really helps. What most of us think is that our problem can be understood only by us and that no talking is going to help.    37    Talking helps you move on and let go.
Write your problems.    38    When you write down your problems, you are setting free all the tension from your system. You can try throwing away the paper on which you wrote your problems. By doing this, imagine yourself throwing away the problems from your life.
Don’t lose faith and hope. No matter what you lose in life, don’t lose faith and hope. Even if you lose all your money, family… you should still have faith.    39    
	Your problems aren’t the worst. No matter what problem you get in life, there’re another one million people whose problems are huger than yours.    40    Your problems might just seem big and worse, but in reality they can be removed.
	Go about and solve your problems because every problem, however big or small, always has a way out.
A．When we have a problem, a pressing, critical, urgent, life-threatening problem, how do we try and solve it?
B．But the truth is that when you talk about it, you’re setting free the negative energies that have been gathering within you.    
C．Having a personal diary can also be of huge help if you don’t want a real person to talk with.
D．We can often overcome the problem and achieve the goal by making a direct attack.
E．Of course, we’ve been fighting troubles ever since we were born.
F．With faith and hope, you can rebuild everything that you lose.
G．Tell yourself: when they can deal with them, why can’t I?

My class and I visited Chris Care Center in Phoenix, Arizona to comfort the old people who needed a little cheering up during the holiday season.

Justin also   53   the same lady. The difference between us is that he   54   on her needs, but I didn’t. During the last song, “Silent Night,” Justin walked over to her and held her hand.

It   58    a boy to teach me, a man, about kindness and love. Justin’s example of a complete, selfless attitude toward another was a   59   that I will never forget. He was the teacher that day, and I consider myself   60   to have witnessed his lesson.

It is recommended that one of the effective ways to make your English writing skills improved should be keeping a diary.
   61   (compare) with other form of writing， it takes   62   (little) time as well as being shorter. It is   63    (general) recognized that you will get to learn how to express yourself in English if you insist on practising. Apparently you may meet with   64   good many difficulties at times. The  trouble is     65   you can not find appropriate words and phrases to give expression to your mind. In addition, there are lots of idiomatic ways of Chinese appearing in your diary.  
   66  my point of view, a piece of good advice is that there should be no  67  way more suitable than keeping a notebook and an English dictionary within easy reach. Whenever something    68   (beat) you, put   69   down and then consult the dictionary. Certainly you can get help from your English teacher if necessary. I’m sure it is of great use to keep a diary in English for the   70   (improve) of writing abilities.

第二部分阅读理解（共两节，满分40分）
第一节（共15小题；每小题2分，满分30分）
阅读下列短文，从每题所给的四个选项（A，B、C和D）中，选出最佳选项，并在答题卡上将该项涂黑。
                                      A
   Don't drive your kids to school. Let them ride a bike to school. 
In England 8.3 million children travel to school every day. It is reported that only a small number of pupils cycle to school (under 2%), although one in three children would actually like to. 
Experts say that to stay healthy, children need at least one hour of moderate exercise every day. But only six out of ten boys and four out of ten girls get that. One of the reasons is that parents have developed a habit of driving their children to school when they could just walk or ride a bike to school. 
Teachers often say that children who walk or ride a bike to school are more ready to listen to their classes, ask and answer questions in class than those driven by car, and the school journey is a good chance for children to learn about road safety and other life skills. Also, for many children, riding a bike is more fun than going to school by car. 
Most parents know the benefits. Then what's stopping them from letting their kids ride a bike? Safety is the number one worry for them. But actually riding a bike is not as dangerous as parents think it is. 
When you decide to buy a bike, you should be aware that a bike that is too big or too small is dangerous. Don't try to get a bike that your child will “grow into”. Get the right size in good working order. Generally, 20­inch wheels are on bikes for 5～8 year olds; 24­inch wheels are for 9～11 year olds; 26­inch wheels are suitable for those over 11, and some older children should even take bikes with 28­inch wheels, but the main thing is that the bike fits your child.
21．This passage is mainly written for ________.
A. parents who send and receive their children to school

During the Second World War, I met a housewife from Chicago who told me how she discovered for herself that "the cure for worry is to get completely occupied doing something constructive.’’ I met this woman and her husband in the dining car while l was traveling from New York to my farm in Missouri.
This couple told me that their son had joined the armed forces the day after the attack on
Pearl Harbor. The woman told me that she had almost ruined her health worrying over that
only son. Where was he? Was he safe? Would he be wounded? Killed?
    When I asked her how she overcame her worry, she replied: "I got busy.” She told me that
at first she had dismissed her maid and tried to keep busy by doing all her housework herself.
But that didn’t help much. "The trouble was," she said, "that I could do my housework almost
mechanically（机械地）.So I kept on worrying. Then I realized I needed some new kind of work
that would keep me busy both mentally and physically. So I took a job as a saleswoman in a
store. "
     "That did it," she said. "I immediately found myself involved in a lot of activities: customers
crowding around me, asking for prices, sizes, colors. Never a second to think of anything except
my immediate duty. And when night came, I could think of nothing except getting off my aching
feet. As soon as I ate dinner, I fell into bed and instantly became unconscious. I had neither the time nor 
the energy to worry. "
29. Doing housework failed to work on the woman because_______.
   A. there wasn't much housework to do               B. she didn't like doing housework at all
   C. she didn't need to use her mind to do housework    D. it was too boring to do housework
30. Why did the woman take a job as a saleswoman?
   A. She had to work to support her family.    B. She enjoyed being surrounded by people.
   C. She wanted to make her life more colorful.    
D. She needed a more effective way to defeat her worry.
31.  After a day's work as a saleswoman, the woman_______.
    A. seemed quite disappointed                     B. felt extremely tired
    C. fell into unconsciousness because of worries      D. lost her appetite

D
   Like many old towns in the forested valleys of the Northwest, Albany, Ore, has seen its
share of ups and downs over the years, but when the local economy began to decline some 15 years ago, the downs seemed to outnumber the ups.
   "Albany was changing completely. We had to find a way to reinvent ourselves," says Wendy Kirbey, the former owner of a coffee shop downtown. So in 2002,Kirbey,69,proposed (提议) a project she hoped would help her town rediscover its pride: a Victorian-style carousel (旋转木马),the animals carved by the townspeople themselves.
   "It felt like the perfect fit for our historical town," she says. Despite a sceptical city council (议会) and a starting budget of only $ 150,Kfrbey and a handful of volunteers got to work.
   Ten years later, more than 300 people have spent nearly 150,000 hours on the Albany Carousel, making a lively herd of unusual creatures. Each of the 52 animals has been "adopted" by a sponsor, who oversees its creation and often adds a personal touch.
   The project has shown the diverse skills and creative talents of Albany (pop. 50,000). "The amazing thing about this attempt is that whenever we’ve needed something, it’s been provided for us," says Kirbey. "Somebody's aunt knows somebody's uncle who comes down to lend a hand".
     Kirbey says it will take two more years to complete the project. But the carousel is already working its magic. "It is our town’s No. 1 attraction," says Rod Porsche of the Albany Visitors Association. As the animals are completed, they're put on show in local hotels, restaurants and shops; people who come to see the fantastical figures around town and tour the workshop (as many as 2,000 visitors a month) are helping Albany with its economic recovery. "I can’t imagine how great it’s going to be when the carousel is up and running," Porsche says.
32. What can we learn about the carousel?
   A. It cost a fortune.             B. It looks very modern.
   C. It received support from all walks of life.       D. It took ten years to build.
33. By saying the underlined sentence, Kirbey wants to tell us_______ .
   A. the townspeople are closely linked         B. it is a small world
   C. uncles and aunts make great efforts        D. help is at hand
34. What can we infer from the last paragraph?
 A. Porsche has made an outstanding contribution to Albany.  
B. Porsche is sceptical of the town-s attractions.
 C. Porsche has made many friends through the project.      
D. Porsche thinks highly of the project.
35. The text is mainly about_______.
 A. how a struggling town found a way to create a little magic   B. the ups and downs of Albany
 C. how the carousel would help a town recover its culture      D. the creative talents of Albany

Question: I have been learning English for about 7 years. __36__ And I still can't make myself understood in English. However, I love learning English. How can I learn English well? Please help me.
Answer: Many people have asked me this question. __37__ Here I will give you several tips for learning English.
● __38__
First of all, you must want to learn. If you are not interested in learning English, no class will help you and no book will help you. So you have to be honest with yourself. Ask yourself, “Do I really want to learn English？” If you can't answer “yes” to this question, it is better for you to set English aside until you're ready and willing to learn.
● Set goals (目标)．
To learn English well, you must set some goals. __39__ It will also help you to see your progress. Ask yourself, “What are my goals? What areas would I like to improve？” Think about what your goals are, and review once in a while to see that you are making progress toward your goals.
● Practice, practice, and practice.
After you have set your goals, you have a better idea of what you need to practice. Just like the athlete whose goal is the Olympics must train daily, you as a language learner must practice language every day to make progress toward your goal. __40__
A. The answers are as different as the people asking the question.
B. The more you practice, the more progress you will make.
C. Make friends with some Americans online.
D. I think it is not easy to learn it well.
E. Want to learn.
F. Reading is a very good way to learn new words.
G. Having goals will help you remember what areas you want to work on.

Good morning, everyone.
It’s my honor to stand here with you to say something about ourselves. Now we are busy preparing for our coming College Entrance Examination. As we see, we are always studying hard and happily competing with each other. Of course, our parents and our teachers are pleased that we have made some progress.
But here I would like to tell you what we should pay attention to. Some of us have little self-confidence to improve our scores and some have no clear aims. To our worry, many of us don’t take part in any physical exercise. If so for long, we will have no strength to carry on our study.
In y opinion, it is necessary for us to fill ourselves with confidence fully. We must make our aims clear and make plans for them. It is the most important to work hard in possibly scientific ways.
At last, may all of us get our own success! We are sure to get our own success!
Thank you!

A
Tayka Hotel de Sal
Where: Tahua, Bolivia
How much: About $ 95 a night
Why it’s cool: You’ve stayed at hotels made of brick or wood, but salt? That’s something few can claim. Tayka Hotel de Sal is made totally of salt---including the beds (though you’ll sleep on regular mattresses and blankets). The hotel sits on the Salar de Uyuni, a prehistoric dried-up lake which is the world’s biggest salt flat. Builders use the salt from the 4,633-square-mile flat to make the bricks, and glue them together with a paste (糊) of wet salt that hardens when it dries. When rain starts to dissolve (溶解) the hotel, the owners just mix up more salt paste to strengthen the bricks.
Green Magic Nature Resort
Where: Vythiri, India
How much: About $ 240 a night
Why it’s cool: Taking a pulley(滑轮)---operated lift 86 feet to your treetop room is just the start of your adventure. As you look out of your open window, there is no glass! You watch monkeys and birds in the rain forest canopy(罩篷). Later you might test your fear of heights by crossing the handmade rope bridge to the main part of the hotel, or just sit on your bamboo bed and read. You don’t even have to come down for breakfast---the hotel will send it up on the pulley-drawn “elevator”.
Dog Bark Park Inn B&B
Where: Cottonwood, Idaho
How much: $ 92 a night
Why it’s cool: This doghouse isn’t just for the family pet. Sweet Willy is a 30-foot-tall dog with guest rooms in his belly. Climb the wooden stairs beside his hind leg to enter the door in his side. You can relax in the main bedroom, go up a few steps of the loft(阁楼) in Willy’s head, or hang out inside his nose. Although you have a full private bathroom in your quarters, there is also a toilet in the 12-foot-tall fire hydrant(消防栓) outside.
Gamirasu Cave Hotel
Where: Ayvali, Turkey
How much: Between $ 130 and $ 450 a night
Why it’s cool: Experience what it was like 5,000 years ago, when people lived in these mountain caves formed by volcanic ash. But your stay will be much more modern. Bathrooms and electricity provide what you expect from a modern hotel, and the white volcanic ash, called tufa, keeps the rooms cool in summer. (Don’t worry--- there is heat in winter.)
21. What do we know about Tayka Hotel de Sal?
   A. It is located on a prehistoric lake.
   B. It should be protected against the rain.
   C. Everything in the hotel is made of salt.
   D. You have to cross a rope bridge to the hotel.
22. How are the hotels similar?
   A. Expensive.                   	B. Comfortable.
   C. Natural.                    		D. Unique.
23. What do the underlined words “Sweet Willy” refer to?
   A. The loft of the hotel.
   B. The name of the hotel owner.
   C. The building of Dog Bark Park Inn B&B.
   D. The name of a pet dog of the hotel owner.
24. Which of the hotels gives you a feeling of living in the far past?
   A. Tayka Hotel de Sal.

The Owl Count
Annie slept in the front of the seat with her father drove through the darkness. “We’re almost there!” Dad announced cheerfully. “Soon we’ll be observing and counting owls at the state park.” Yawning, Annie nodded and smiled. The time was 4:30 a.m. Looking out into the darkness, Annie remembered learning in school that most owls are active at night, when they hunt for food. During the day they sleep in hard-to-find spots. 
“Dad, why do you need to count owls?” she asked. “It’s important for the scientists to have current information about bird populations,” he explained. “We want to know which birds have decreased in number and whether any new kinds of birds are coming into a certain area. You and I will write down the kinds of birds that we see today and keep a record of how many times we see each kind. Then we’ll send out a report to a scientific organization that is collecting about birds from people all over the country.”
Dad pulled into the parking lot of the state park. Then, with flashing in hand, they began their hike into the woods. Annie zipped up her coat and tried to keep from trembling. She had not expected the morning to be so cold. Luckily her gloves were in her pocket.
Suddenly Annie’s father stopped and gestured for her to be still. Obeying, Annie did not take another step. She thought she heard a low crying up head. “That’s certainly a screech owl,” her father whispered. “Let’s get a look at it.” After looking more closely, Annie could see that it was a small owl. Sensing danger, the owl narrowed its eyes and pulled its feathers tightly against its body. Annie carefully wrote down in her notebook that they had seen a screech owl.
Walking a little farther, they came to a tall oak tree. “This looks like a perfect spot to attract owls,” Dad said, “I’m going to play a recording of common call of the barred owl. Maybe we can get one to answer.’ Annie could hardly believe her ear. The recorded call sounded as if the bird were asking, “Who cooks for you?” Moments later Annie thought she heard a return call in the distance. She held her breath and waited. Suddenly a huge bird landed very quietly on a branch above them.
Annie had long forgotten how cold it was. She stood in wonder, shining her flashlight on the bird and studying it carefully. The barred owl was nearly two feet tall. Grey feathers surrounded its dark eyes. The bird did not stay long, but it did not matter. Annie would never forget the image of the powerful barred owl. 
25. Why did Annie and her father go to the state park?
A. To take a hike in the woods.			
B. To record the call of barred owl.
C. To collect information about birds.	
D. To protect the environment for wildlife.
26. In paragraph 4, why did Annie’s father stop her suddenly?
A. He noticed a screech owl. 
B. He heard somebody crying.
C. He sensed they were in danger.
D. He reminded her to take down note.
27. How did Annie feel when she saw the barred owl?
A. Bored			B. Amazed		C. Frightened			D. Relaxed

I told my friend Graham that I often cycle two miles from my house to the town centre but unfortunately there is a big hill on the route. He replied, “You mean fortunately.” He explained that I should be glad of the extra exercise that the hill provided.
My attitude to the hill has now changed. I used to complain as I approached it but now I tell myself the following. This hill will exercise my heart and lungs. It will help me to lose weight and get fit. It will mean that I live longer. This hill is my friend. Finally I comfort myself with the thought of all those silly people who pay money to go to a gym and sit on stationery exercise bicycles when I can get the same value for free. I have a smile of satisfaction as I reach the top of the hill.
Problems are there to be faced and overcome. We cannot achieve anything with an easy life. Helen Keller was the first deaf and blind person to gain a university degree. Her activism and writing proved inspirational. She wrote, “Character cannot be developed in ease. Only through experiences of suffering can the soul be strengthened, vision cleared, ambition inspired and success achieved.”
One of the main determinants of success in life is our attitude towards adversity (逆境). From time to time we all face hardships, problems, accidents and difficulties. Some are of our making but many are no fault of our own. While we cannot choose the adversity, we can choose our attitude towards it.
Douglas Bader was 21 when in 1931 he had both legs cut off following a flying accident．He was determined to fly again and went on to become one of the leading flying aviators in the Battle of Britain with 22 aerial victories over the Germans．He was an inspiration to others during the war. He said, “Don’t listen to anyone who tells you that you can’t do this or that. That’s nonsense. Make up your mind, you’ll never use crutches (拐杖) or a stick, and then have a go at everything. Go to school, and join in all the games you can. Go anywhere you want to. But never, never let them persuade you that things are too difficult or impossible.”
The biographies (传记) of great people are full of examples of how they took steps to overcome the difficulties they faced. The common thread is that they did not become depressed. They chose their attitude. They chose to be positive. They took on the challenge. They won.
Nevertheless, there is still the problem of how you change your attitude towards adversity.
28. Which of the following is true according to the author of the passage?
A. Going to a gym is greatly beneficial to people’s health.
   	B. Climbing hills on bicycles is the best way to take exercise. 
   	C. Those who want to achieve success can’t expect to live an easy life.
   	D. People’s attitude to adversity is the only factor of their success.
29. By quoting what Douglas Bader said, the author intends to tell us “       .”
   	A. Failure is the mother of success．    	
B. A bad workman quarrels with his tools.
C. If you risk nothing, you will have nothing.
D. Nothing is difficult to the man who will try.
30. Following this passage, the author will further talk about        .
   	A. how his friend helped him to change his attitude towards the adversity he faced
  	B. what steps to take to change your attitude towards the adversity you face
   	C. why it is important to keep optimistic in face of adversity
   	D. what great people have in common 
31. Which of the following can best function as the title of the passage?
   	A. Face adversity with a smile		
B. Different attitudes towards adversity
C. Nothing is impossible 			
D. Life is full of adversity 
D
Adding math talk to story time at home is a winning factor for children’s math achievement, according to a new research from the University of Chicago. The study from psychologists Sian Beilock and Susan Levine shows a marked increase in math achievement among children whose families used Bedtime Math, an iPad app that delivers engaging math story problems for parents and children to solve together. 
 	Even children who used the app with their parents as little as once a week saw gains in math achievement by the end of the school year. The app’s effect was especially strong for children whose parents tend to be anxious or uncomfortable with math.
	Previous research from this group has demonstrated the importance of adults’ attitudes about math for children’s math success. For example, a recent study found that math-anxious parents who help their children with math homework actually weaken their children’s math achievement. 
 	The new findings demonstrate that structured, positive interactions around math at home can cut the link between parents’ uneasiness about math and children’s low math achievement.
 	“Many Americans experience high levels of anxiety when they have to solve a math problem, with a majority of adults feeling at least some worries about math,” said Beilock, professor in Psychology and author of Choke, a book about stress and performance. “These math-anxious parents are probably less likely to talk about math at home, which affects how competent their children are in math. Bedtime Math encourages a dialogue between parents and kids about math, and offers a way to engage in high-quality math interactions in a low-effort, high-impact way.” 
 	Study participants included 587 first-grade students and their parents. Families were given an iPad installed with a version of the Bedtime Math app, with which parents and their children read stories and answer questions involving math, including topics like counting, shapes and problem-solving. A control group received a reading app that had similar stories without the math content and questions related to reading comprehension instead. Children’s math achievement was assessed at the beginning and end of the school year. Parents completed a questionnaire about their nervousness with math. 
 	The more times parents and children in the math group used the app, the higher children’s achievement on a math assessment at the end of the school year. Indeed, children who frequently used the math app with their parents outperformed similar students in the reading group by almost three months in math achievement at year’s end.
32.	Bedtime Math is an iPad app that _____.
	A. requires parents and children to answer reading comprehension questions 
	B. assesses children’s math achievement and parents’ nervousness with math
	C. teaches children how to count, recognize shapes and solve practical problems
	D. encourages children together with their parents to solve math story problems 
33.	The previous study found that _____.
	A. help from math-anxious parents improves children’s math achievement
	B. children’s math achievement is related to parents’ attitude about math
	C. interactions around math at home will cut off the family relationship
	D. children can achieve more success if they see the importance of math
34.	We can infer from the passage that ______.
	A. children using the app for three months can see gains in math achievement
	B. children whose parents are uneasy about math outperform other students
	C. it is the math problems related to the stories that make the great difference 
	D. the frequency of using the app has nothing to do with children’s achievement
35.	Which is the best title for the passage? 
	A. High-quality math interactions improve performance.
	B. Frequent use of app can develop problem solving ability.
	C. Low-effort activities create good parent-child relationship.
	D. High-anxiety parents influence children’s attitude about math.

根据短文内容，从短文后的选项中选出能填入空白处的最佳选项，并在答题卡上将该项涂黑。选项中有两项为多余选项。
    I’m 30 years old, and there are several things that life has taught me that I want to share with you．Here are the 4 lessons that life has taught me in the past 30 years．
1.Take care of your body
Life is “unfairly” biased (偏向的) towards people who “look good,” like it or not. So it’s important that you do all that is in your power to look your best．    36    You will live longer, and you will live happier, if you take care of your body; you may even get promoted faster on your job. Remember that your health is really your greatest wealth.
    2.    37        
    No one taught me to save when I was growing up; no one told me the importance of saving. Fortunately I was able to learn the value of saving through reading great books like “The Millionaire Next Door”. What I want to teach others is to save at least twenty percent of your income. If you are to be wealthy, you must not just earn a lot, you must save a lot．
    3.Think in the long term
    In high school I was thinking about college, in college I was thinking about life after college. I’m designing my life and I’m making decisions today that will enable me to live the life I desire when I’m in my 40’s, 50’s and 60’s. You have to think in the long term; you have to see the “big picture”.    38
    4.Realize the power of focus
    Focus, focus, focus…    39    If you fail in this lifetime, you will fail because of broken focus. If you focus on the goals that are most important to you, you will achieve them. The problem is that there are so many distractions.     40    Winners decide to major on majors, and they even let important things slip, because they just focus on achieving what is critical to their goals. 
A．The importance of saving.
B．If you plan your future properly, you will live into your plans.
C．Save your money.
D．Nothing is more important than focus．
E．What separates the winners from the losers is that the winners learn to focus on their goals．
F．I mean dressing nicely, working out and eating right．
G．It’s important that you pursue relationships with individuals who are good first．

Dear friends,
Do you want to live on a beautiful campus? If so, we’d bear the following in mind.
To begin with, we’d turn off lights and close the taps when we don’t use them. Also, we should take public transportation instead of cars and taxis. In addition, don’t throw rubbish around and remember to refuse to use once-off chopsticks and plastic bags. Last but not least, we’d be totally for the “Clear Your Plate Campaign”. Only in this way can we make our schoolyard more beautiful.
Let’s take action and make some contributions to the environmental protection.
Thank you!

Ella Wood will graduate from Miami University next year with a master’s degree in public health. she is hoping to get a job in public health. But she has some worries. 
Public service doesn't pay much, and her study at Miami University costs about $50,000 a year with living expenses. Ella has a scholarship from Miami University that covers just $4,000 a year and has taken out loans to pay for the rest. She would spend years paying back her student loans and not have money left over.      
The good news is that in 2008, Congress recognized that there were so many students in Ella’s position that it passed the College Cost Reduction Act. There were two programs established by this act that Ella could look into. The first is the income-based repayment plan, which allows lower-income graduates with a lot of debt to reduce their monthly payments. “Depending on a graduate's income and level of debt, the program, could limit her annual educational loan debt repayment to 15 percent of real income.” said Peter William, vice chairman of the College Saving Foundation.
The second is the public service loan forgiveness（贷款减免）plan, in which the federal government will forgive the remaining debt of borrowers who make 10-year loan payment while working full time in public-service jobs. But the graduate must have a certain loan which is listed in the plan. “Typically, it is projected that a borrower who performs public service under this program will repay only about one-fourth to one-half as much money as a borrower who does not,” William said. He also pointed out that public service is broadly defined and includes any government and nonprofit organization job.
21. What might Ella Wood be concerned most when she graduates next year?
A. She might not a master’s degree directly.
B. She might not find a job in public health easily.
C. She had to pay back her scholarship to Miami University.
D. She wondered how to ease the pain of being in debt for years.
22. How can Ella benefit from the first program mentioned in the passage?
A. The income tax will be cut down.
B. One four of debt will be forgiven.
C. The total amount of debt will be reduced.
D. Ella will have more time to pay back the debt.
23. We can learn from the passage that______.
A. every graduate will get a scholarship like Ella.
B. graduates who work in public service get the highest payment.
C. the federal government encourages graduates to work in public service.
D. the College Cost Reduction Act only helps graduates with master’s degree.
24.What’s the main idea of the passage?
A. The total expense in American universities is too high.
B. The US government is trying to relieve graduates from heavy debt.
C. There are a lot of different programs to help students pay their tuition.
D. The US government forces all students to choose public-service jobs.
B
Facebook and Twitter have become a significant threat to marriage – with social media now a factor in an increasing number of divorce cases, say lawyers.
One in seven married individuals have considered divorce because of their spouse’s（配偶） postings of Facebook or other online sites, according to research. A similar percentage admit that they search online for evidence of their spouse’s disloyalty, while nearly one in five say they have daily quarrels because of the way their husband or wife uses social media. The research was assigned by law firm  Gordon in response to an increase in the number of its clients who said that Facebook, Skype, Snapchat, Twitter or other social media sites had played a part in their divorce.
Andrew Newbury, of law firm Gordon, said: ‘Social media is the new marriage. Five years ago Facebook was rarely mentioned in the context of a marriage ending, but now it has become common.” Social media, specific pictures and posts on Facebook, are now being routinely raised in divorces.’  The survey by Censuswide among 2011 husbands and wives, found the most common reasons for checking their spouse’s social media accounts were to discover who they were talking to, who they were meeting and where they were going. A quarter of the married people said the resulting suspicions led to quarrels at least once a week, and 17 percent said such quarrels were daily events.
Arguments were caused by contact with former partners, by the sending of secret messages, and by the posting of ‘inappropriate’ pictures. Some 14 percent said they looked at their spouse’s social media with the specific intention of detecting evidence of adultery（出轨）. 
25. The underlined word “disloyalty” in Paragraph 2 probably means_______.
A. affection                              B. discomfort
C. dishonesty                             D. violence
26. What might checking spouse’s social media accounts result in?
A. The couple let out secrets quickly.       
    B. The couple lost trust between each other.
    C. All the couples quarreled at least once a week.  
    D. The couple felt comfortable about their relationship.
27. By saying “Social media is the new marriage minefield”, Andrew means that______.
A. a new marriage needs social media field
B. social media is a good thing to marriage
C. social media is a new field of communication
D. marriage ending will be caused by social media
28. What can be the best title for the passage?
A. Facebook, a Multifunctional Tool                B. Social Media, a Threat to Marriage
C. Posting Pictures is Killing Marriage              D. Argument about Social Media Sites

Most of us would like to have glowing skin, especially as we get older. The good news is that you don’t have to wait until summer to catch some sun rays. Scientists have found eating plenty of fruit and vegetables is by far the best way to achieve a healthy, golden glow.
Dr. Ian Stephen said, “Most people think that the best way to improve their skin color is to get a suntan（棕褐色）. But our research shows that eating lots of fruit and vegetables is actually more effective.”
The team first assessed the skin color of people in relation to their diet. Those who ate more fruit and vegetables a day were found to have a more golden, yellow skin color. Those with a healthy glow had a higher presence of carotenoids（类胡萝卜素）, which play a role in the immune system. Carotenoids are commonly found in fruit and vegetables such an yellow and red peppers, spinach, apricots and melons.
The team then studied the relation between skin tone and attractiveness. They used specialist software to operate the skin color on the images of 51 faces to simulate（模拟）more or less carotenoids and suntans. Participants were then asked to adjust the skin color to make the faces look as healthy as possible. Given the choice between skin color enhanced by suntans and skin color enhanced by carotenoids, people preferred the carotenoids skin color.
   The study shows that not only do people use skin color to judge how healthy other individuals are, but they are accurate when they make those judgments. While this study focus on Caucasian（白种人的）faces, it suggests this phenomenon may exist across cultures, since similar preferences for skin yellowness are found in an African population.
32. Which statement is TRUE according to the text”
A. Carotenoids are only found in the fruit.
B. Carotenoids are important in the immune system
C. Carotenoids can be improved by catching sun rays.
D. Carotenoids are the only factor that affects the skin color.
33. According to the text, people preferred________.
A. the yellow skin color                           B. the skin color as white as possible
C. the skin color enhanced by suntans          D. the skin color enhanced by carotenoids
34. What can we lean from the text?
A. Young girls should not eat many melons.
B. There’s no need to worry about our skin color.
C. We cannot judge a person from his appearance.
D. Skin color is a clue to judge whether a person is healthy or not.
35. What’s the author’s intention of writing this passage?
A. To show us how to get glowing skin.
B. To persuade us to get suntans every day.
C. To explain different diets in different cultures.
D. To share his experience of improving the skin.

Self-motivation
Self-motivation occurs when a person has the willingness to do something and is internally(内在地)motivated to do it.
__36  . There is a job to go to, groceries to do, television to watch—whoops! I guess we get pretty good at finding excuses to escape getting started on goals like an exercise routine or reading a new book．The fact is that we are creatures of routine and habit．So what can we do to motivate ourselves to accomplish our goals?   37    
  ●Decide what you want
It’s hard to motivate an aimless mind.   38  Then break it down into smaller sections so it’s easier to handle and less overwhelming．（势不可挡）
  ●Keep track of your progress．
Keep a journal where you can measure how much you have accomplished．  39  
●Post motivating pictures or slogans within your sight．
It is always inspiring to see pictures of people who have accomplished what you’re going for．It makes it attainable．Likewise, little slogans like “go for it” or “just do it” can give you the little support you need．

参考范文
There are various ways to express love.I think saying “I Love you” on my father’s or mother’s birthday is a good way to let my parents know how I love them.
I am sure if I often help my parents do some simple housework that I can do，especially when they are tired after work，my parents must feel my love to them.Besides，I will often give my parents a hug because I learn that people can get relaxed through a warm hug and feel connected to each other，which does good to their health.Getting small but meaning gifts must be an exciting moment for my loved and I think I will do so on some special days.

      The old shopkeeper led me through to the back of the shop. The room was filled with boxes and dusty
 photographs of people holding packages in their hands.
      Mr. Hopkins said, "We have a very wide choice of items for sale. Whenever I serve a new customer,
 I take his picture. "  Mr. Hopkins pointed to an ancient camera on a table.
      I began to appreciate the lovely items on sale. I spent a very pleasant hour being shown the commodi-
  ties in the shop. Finally,  I bought an antique jewelry box, a pair of riding boots and a sewing machine.
     I was very excited that I had found such a good little shop. "I will tell all my friends about your love-
ly place. " I told the shopkeeper. "Please don't do that, sir. " said Mr. Hopkins. "This is a special place
  for special people. You must keep this shop a secret. " Then he took my photograph and handed me the
 picture straight away.
      " That was quick ! " I exclaimed. In the picture I looked proud and excited holding the presents I had
 bought there.
     On Christmas Day, my friends and relatives were delighted with the presents I had bought for them.
  For weeks, my brother begged me to take him to the wonderful little shop. I finally agreed.
       We walked along Oxford Street, past the department store and found---nothing. In its place was an
  empty space being used as a car park. I checked the area again. There was the music shop, and there was
 the department store. In between should have been Hopkins and Son, but it wasn't there.
     Just then, an old policeman came. "Are you looking for something, sir?" he asked. "I am looking
for a little shop called Hopkins and Son. "
     "Oh yes, there was a shop here 'once called Hopkins and Son. But it was knocked down over 30
 years ago. "
      I looked again at the place, then I reached into my pocket and took out the photograph that Mr. Hop-
 kins had taken of me holding my presents in the little shop.
        " How strange ! "  I screamed.
 24. What did the author think of Hopkins and Son?

      China's admiration of outstanding scholars has turned the well-preserved childhood home of  Tu
 Youyou,  the Chinese pharmacologist(药理学家)  who won this year's Nobel Prize in physiology(生理学)
 or Medicine, into a popular tourist destination.
       Since it was announced on Monday that 84-year-old Tu had become the first Chinese citizen to win
 this international prize, her former home in the old town of Ningbo, Zhejiang province, has attracted visi-
 tors, especially parents and their children-even though it is not open to the public.
        The house, where Tu lived until she went to university in Beijing, covers an area of 2,200 square
 meters and is priced at 150 million yuan( $ 23. 6 million) . It is part of a complex of 37 traditional build-
ings, including several city-and-district-level cultural relic preservation sites, that have been trans-
 formed into a high-end art, and commercial zone, ' .
       "There are continually parents taking their children, from infants in strollers to college students, to
 take photos in front of Tu's former home. Security guards have been ordered to go on patrol around the
 clock,"  said Mr. Zhao, a salesperson from Ningbo Real Estate Inc Co.
       Shanghai resident Xu Lingfei, who was on a trip to Ningbo, took her 9-y.ear-old son to walk around
 the complex on Wednesday. "Chinese people believe in exams and awards and have a strong preference
 for high performers. Taking children to visit the former dwelling places of celebrities(名人)  is a way to
 inspire them to study harder," Xu said.
      Something similar happened. after Mo Yan won the Nobel Prize for literature in 2012. Tourists started
 visiting Mo's former home in rural Caomi, Shandong Province, in an endless stream starting the day after
 he won the prize. Some even pulled the radishes planted in front of the house. and carried away some
bricks.
 28. Tu Youyou's former house is now popular mainly because .           .
     A. Tu won the Nobel Prize
     B. it has some cultural relics
     C.  it covers a large area
     D.  it is a great art and commercial zone
 29. Why did Xu Lingfei take her son to visit Tu's former home?
       A. She admired Tu very much.
       B. She planned to buy the house.   .
       C. She intended to take photos there.
       D. She wanted her son to be inspired.
 30. Where is Mo Yan's former home located?
      A. Shanghai.         B. Gaomi.         C. Ningbo.         D. Beijing.     . .
 31. What is the main idea of the text?
     A. Tu Youyou's former home is for sale.
     B. More Chinese have won the Nobel Prize.
     C. Nobel winner's home becomes instant attraction.
     D. Children benefit from visiting Nobel winner's home.
                                  D
    When people introduce themselves,  I always hear them say "I'm just a housewife".  I don't understand
why their introduction is always filled with regret and self - pity.  Is it, really a crime to be a housewife? Is it
really embarrassing when you choose not to work outside and instead choose to work in  your home？
    How could you be "just a housewife" when the basic social unit of society depends on you and your
service? A housewife works for the longest hour, supporting your husband, child studies, caring for eld-
ers, managing finances, paying bills, grocery shopping, cooking according to individual taste-, cleaning,
etc. A housewife could be anyone: daughter, wife, mother, teacher, financial advisor, fashion designer
and nurse, gardener, driver, cook, and so on.  Don't think you are not being paid for it.  You ~;et the re-
ward that no money can offer-the love and affection of your family, their trust洒 you, a happy home and
your own satisfaction.
     It is you who choose to be in this occupation, willingly or for any other reason.  After a busy day, all
wait to return to the comfortable home set by you. They know you will be there to absorb all their stress
and tiredness and relax them. Would the life have been the same had you been working outside to earn
some money? Would you along with your family have been able to buy all the content in life that you are
enjoying now with that money?
    Respect yourself for what you are. Introduce yourself to the world with the same dignity. The world
understands the importance of your job; it's time to make them accept it. Introduce yourself with pride
and with twinkle in your eyes "I am a housewife". Kick that "just" out.     .
32. How do people feel when they say "I'm just a housewife": ？
   A. Satisfied.              B. Proud.          C. Regretful.                   D. Anxious.
33.  Listing the housewife's duties, the author implies a housewife             .
     A. usually leads a terrible life
     B. plays a more important role
    C. does not always get her reward
    D. makes a great contribution to the family
34.  If a housewife worked outside, she would             .
    A. have the same life like before           B. set a comfortable home for her family
    C. absorb her family's stress           D. lose the content that she is enjoying
35. What is the author's attitude toward housewives?
      A. Supportive.        B. Doubtful.         C. Opposed.                   D. Tolerant.

The Lost Rules of Etiquette
    Etiquette, or good manners, used to be the glue that held society together. 36    Sadly, these days
it has mostly gone by the wayside. This list is several best rules of etiquette that have now disappeared.
  Opening the Door
  In days gone by, a gentleman would always open doors for ladies. 37   This h8s now almost entire-
ly disappeared-and it is pot entirely the fault of the men. I have seen women laugh at men for opening a
door for them. They seem to be confusing manners with chauvinism(大男子主义)．
    Writing Thank-You Notes
    In days gone by, whenever a person received a gift, they would write a thank-you note as soon as
possible.  38 Parents would sit children down after a birthday or Christmas and coach them in their
first thank-you note. It is a shame that gift giving has now become a virtual obligation and the idea of a
thank-you note would be laughed at.
    39     
    We seem to have completely lost the concept of correct timing when it comes to parties these days. 
  40    After all, a party normally has a guest of honor-this is usually the oldest woman present. It was
considered extremely rude in the past to leave a party before the guest of honor-and once the guest of
honor left, it was a signal to all that they should begin their own preparations to leave.
A. Arriving on Time.
B. Leaving at the Right Time.
C. People leave with various excuses.
D. It enabled people  to get on well、with each other.
E. This rule was true even if the giver was a relative.
F. It could be the lady they were driving, or a stranger.
G. We've thrown away the concept of a guest of honor at will.

       A woman was taken to the hospital. While having an operation, she had a nearly
    death experience. Seeing God, she asked how this was it. God said,” No, you had another
    40 years.” On recovery the women decided to have a plastic surgery. She had someone
    change her hair color, thinking since she had so many time to live, she'd better make full
    use from it. Finally she got out of the hospital. While crossing the street, she killed by an
    ambulance speeded by. Arriving in the front of God, she demanded，“They said I had
    another 40 years!” God replied, “But I didn't recognize you.”

One Possible Version：
Dear Sir or Madam,
I’m writing this letter to apply for the job as a volunteer that you have advertised on the Internet. In my opinion, not only can volunteer work help me enrich my knowledge and experience, but also it can help those who are in need live better and become more confident.
I will graduate from senior high school in June. In the past, I took part in many social activities in which I performed well and gained rich experience. My interest and skill in English, communication and teamwork contribute to my application for the job.
I would appreciate an interview at your convenience. I’m looking forward to hearing from you in the future. 
With all my best regards.
                                                                  Yours sincerely,

 It’s known to us all that most American colleges and universities accept one or both of the two major English language tests. One is the test of English as a Foreign Language, which is known as the TOEFL, given in 180 countries. The other is the International English Language Testing System, or IELTS, which is given in 121 countries. In recent years, the two tests are becoming more and more popular. One million people each year take the TOEFL, and it is the same with the IELTS. 2000 colleges and universities now in the States now recognize the IELTS. Schools might accept it only for undergraduate or graduate admission or both. The IELTS is a paper test, while the TOEFL is given on paper only in places where a computer test is not available. The TOEFL paper test costs 150 dollars, testing reading, listening, and writing. A separate Test of Spoken English costs 125 dollars. The TOEFL and the IELTS both measure all four language skills. But with the IELTS, the speaking test is done separately as a live interview.

                                 A
Dear Vanessa,
   I have long had a bad habit of calling you my “little” sister despite the fact that there are barely two years between us, and you are now in your mid-30s. Perhaps these days calling you my younger sister is preferable. Either way, you seemed neither little nor young these last few days as you added a new, adorable member to our family.
	While I must admit that watching you the other day with your naked daughter lying across your chest, you looked beatific （幸福安详的）in a way I have never seen. I want you to know that I don’t think becoming a mother has made you any more complete, fulfilled or wise, because you were all of these things before your daughter was born. I do think, however, that her arrival means that she will have the great luck of being on the receiving end of all love and thoughtfulness that have always been parts of who you are.
 	I know you are tired now, and will be tired for a while. I promise that I will let you talk about your tiredness as long as you would like to. I also promise that I will never give advice on how to be less tired or suggest that you look tired. Your daughter will be fine whatever you choose to do about childcare. Do what works for you, what you think is right and what makes you happy. The first year is all about survival. 
                                                     		Yours, 
                                                       		 Ella
21. Ella prefers to call Vanessa younger sister instead of little sister because _____.
 	A. Vanessa is already in her mid-30s 		B. she wants to remove her bad habit
 	C. there is a wide age gap between them	D. it is more suitable for a new mother
22. What does the underlined sentence (Paragraph 2) most probably mean ?
 	A. The baby will be bathed in abundant love and care.
 	B. The baby’s arrival brings much luck to the family.
 	C. Vanessa always receives love and thoughtfulness.
 	D. Vanessa has been an important part of the family.
23. What can we infer from the last paragraph?
 	A. Vanessa dislikes being given advice on childcare.
 	B. Vanessa will lead a very tiring and busy life.
 	C. Ella wants to lend a helping hand to her sister.
 	D. Ella is very concerned about the baby’s survival.
24. What’s the tone of the letter? 
 	A. Warm and touching.					B. Appreciative and inspiring.
 	C. Educational and persuasive.			D. Humorous and enthusiastic.

When it comes to body art, most of us think of tattoos, which are permanent pictures drawn on the body using colored ink. Tattoos are often used to show one’s skin and beliefs. However tattoos and other kinds of body art are also used for very important and ceremonial reasons.
The most widely used form of body art is henna(花染料) painting. Painting the body with henna is practiced in a number of Asian and African countries. The leaves of the henna plant are used to paint the skin a reddish-brown color .People in Morocco, a country Africa, use henna paint to protect themselves from evil spirits and prevent bad luck. In Sudan, henna represents happiness. Sudanese women paint henna on their bodies and hair to show how much they love their husbands. The more henna painting on a woman, the more she loves her husband. Men in Sudan also paint their bodies with henna leaves on their wedding day. Henna painting is an old tradition, but nowadays it is also becoming popular in some other parts of the world.
In India ,people also use henna to paint beautiful and detailed patterns on their bodies. This art form has been practiced in India for centuries ,mainly among women. It is commonly seen at Indian celebrations, and brides will have their hands and feet painted a few days before their wedding. Traditionally, the darker the paint is, the longer their love for their husband will last. The color rubs off after some time, so it is important for the women to paint themselves as dark as possible. Some young women in Western countries have become interested in it as a way to make themselves beautiful. In this way, traditional art forms become popular in modern society.
  In Australia, the Aboriginals use colored clay to paint their faces and bodies for special dances and celebrations. For them, body art is an important part of celebrations. They also use body art to communicate and to express their creativity. In fact, the same kind of clay is also used to make art in caves and on rocks.
Some cultures have been practicing body art for thousands of years. Learning about these unique forms of cultural expressions is an interesting way of finding about other cultures and societies.
28.According to paragraph 1,what are Tattoos?
A. An Indian art          				B. A modern invention  
C. A form of body art     				D. Permanent colored ink
29.Where do Sudanese people paint henna?

	There was a time when a trip to the supermarket in the United States often ended with a seemingly simple question from the cashier:“Paper or plastic?” Well, which type of bag would you choose?
While all types of bags have some influence on the environment, it has long been supposed that paper bags are kinder. They are made from a renewable source, break down easily, burn without giving off thick smoke and can be recycled. However, the producing process behind paper bags uses more energy than that of plastic ones. How can this be true?
	Studies show that paper bag production requires four times as much energy as plastic bag production. And the amount of water used to make them is twenty times higher. Besides, the influence on forests is very serious. It takes about fourteen million trees to produce ten billion paper bags, which happens to be the number of bags used in the United States yearly. In terms of recycling, the idea that paper bags are more environment-friendly than plastic ones can be quickly discarded. Research shows it requires about 98% less energy to recycle plastic than it does paper.
	Even though paper bags might be more harmful than plastic ones, plastic still seems to be considered by governments as the more harmful of the two. In Ireland, for example, a tax has been introduced to discourage the use of plastic bags. People have to pay 22 cents for every plastic bag, and as a result, their use has dropped quickly.
	There’s no doubt that it makes more sense to reuse these bags. However, we don’t seem to be doing that at present. That may be because they fall apart quickly. If so, cloth bags are a better choice, but still, their production also has a bad influence on the environment. So what to do? How should we answer the question of “Paper or plastic?” It seems that we first need to ask ourselves one more general question: “What can I do to help the environment?”
32. The questions in Paragraph 1 are used to          .
	A. express the author’s doubts			B. tell readers how to save money
	C. introduce points for discussion			D. show the kindness of the cashier
33. Compared with plastic bags, paper bags        .
	A. need more water to produce			B. require less energy to recycle
	C. take more time to break down			D. have less influence on forests
34. The underlined word “discarded” in Paragraph 3 probably means “       ”.
	A. shared			B. given up 			C. discussed			D. put forward
35. Which question does the author probably hope the cashier will ask?
	A. Paper or cloth?						B. Paper or plastic?
	C. A small bag or big one?				D. A new bag or your own one?

Yawn! If you often feel too tired in the mornings, even if you’re getting 8 hours in, then this article is for you. Waking up still tired is pretty common -- but that doesn’t mean it’s natural.  36  The following tips may help.

   Watching lanterns is a great  63  (active). You see lanterns in any sizes and shapes you can imagine, from animals to plants and flowers.  64  (make) it more fun, people paste riddles on the lanterns. 
In some places, people like releasing sky lanterns, which  65  (call) Kongming lanterns. A sky lantern is a small hot air balloon made of paper,  66  an opening at the bottom where there is a small fire source. When the bright lights fly high in the sky, people bless family members  67  make wishes. 
   In old times, the Lantern Festival was also romantic. At that time, young girls were not allowed to go out very often except during certain festivals.  68  , looking at lanterns gave young people a chance to meet each other. A line from Xin Qiji,  69  poet during the Song Dynasty, shows this: “Restlessly, I searched for her in thousands, hundreds of ways.  70  (sudden) I turned, and there she was in the receding light.”

2014-2015学年度上学期第二次月考试卷
高三英语
时间：100分钟   分数：150分
第一部分：阅读理解（共两节，满分40分）
第一节（共15小题；每小题2分，满分30分）
阅读下列短文，从每题所给的四个选项（A,B,C,和D）中，选出最佳选项，并在答题卡上将该项涂黑。
A
The slogan “a dog is for life, not just for Christmas” has been going strong for 27 years now. Dogs and cats have been popular Christmas gifts in the UK and Europe for many years. But some people still haven’t quite got the message.
    The slogan still holds good.  Some 105,000 dogs were rounded up by local government last year because they had been abandoned, many of them shortly after the festival season.
The main reason given by owners for handing their dogs over to the Dogs Trust is that the dogs need more attention than they can give; behavioral problems and moving home are also reasons given.      
But Eleanor Silk, the Trust’s communications director, says, “It’s often four or five months after Christmas, in early summer, when owners find that the dog has got too big and too active, or it hasn’t been trained properly and has caused damage around the home.”
In any case, some organizations that help pets are quick to point out that if you are serious about getting a puppy as a pet, Christmas is not the time to do it. Puppies need to get used to their new surroundings, to be introduced to a routine, and to be looked after like small children.  It’s hard to meet any of these needs at Christmas. What’s more, pulling a puppy out of a Christmas stocking in itself sends the wrong message to children: it encourages children to think of the puppy as a toy, rather than a responsibility.
Appreciating what you’re taking on with a dog can be a sobering (清醒的) realization. “For life” means thinking about the effect they will have on your life. It also infers you will need to care for the dog for its entire life.
1. According to the passage, which of the following is NOT a reason for pets to be abandoned?
     A. Pets spread some diseases.
     B. Pets damage some things in the house.
     C. The owners can't take good care of the pets.
     D. The owners have to move to other places.
2. The underlined words “rounded up” in Paragraph 2 mean “            .”
     A. given out as gifts            		B. thrown away
     C. raised to make money        		D. gathered into one place
3. The fifth paragraph mainly tells us __           .
    A. bow to take best care of Christmas’pets
    B. the right time to have a puppy as a pet
    C. the reasons why Christmas is not the time to get a pet
D. the worries about Christmas pets from organizations that help pets

The Hunan Satellite TV(HNTV) show “Where are we going, Dad?” is a big hit. Many famous stars brought their children to a strange village alone, and they had to spend 72 hours with their children there. The program fully showed us a modern version of the “how to be a good father”. As the young parents today are too busy to take care of their children, this new form of “Lost on the way” played by nanny Daddy and cute kids triggered（触发）a lot of people’s emotional resonance（共鸣）. Both the kids and their parents will find that their hearts are being drawn closer. But this kind of feeling has just proved that there is a big spiritual barrier between the modern parents and children. 
The TV shows like “Children are hard to support!”, “Where are we going, Dad?”, “Hot Mom” and “Cute Kids” are becoming more and more popular. All of these show the new parents’ confusion in children’s education and the appeal for the balance between career and family.
In real life, on the one hand, the young parents feel helpless because they are too busy to accompany their children under the pressures of work and life; on the other hand, they continue to do so. The data collected by HNTV shows that nearly two-thirds of their audience are female, among whom 36% are aged from 25 to 34.We can imagine such a scene that one evening a young mother is watching the show with her young children, while her husband is still at work or trapped in socializing, or maybe is just playing computer games in the bedroom. The story of a child without the company of father is still going on. In fact, it is sometimes the same to mothers. In a modern family, it is often the old who take the responsibility of raising a child. The participation of mother in the children’s education is also very low.
It is just this kind of confusion where the parents have gone in the modern family education, and where the parents will guide their children to go that “Where are we going，Dad?” shows us. If a child wants to grow up healthily and safely into a modern citizen with independent personality and free spirit, it is very important for him or her to follow the parents who serve as their first teacher. Maybe this is the real reason why such kind of TV programs could get hot. The truth is that children will go where their parents go; and society will go where the children go.
8. In raising a child in modern society, parents should ________.
A. play computer games with their children
B. keep their children at home to avoid socializing
C. break down the barrier between children and teachers
D. balance well between family and career
9. Which of the following can be inferred in the passage?
A. 36% of the audience of the program are female aged from 25-34.
B. Parents shouldn’t entirely leave the education of children to the old. 
C. The program shows us the confusion where the parents and children will go to play.
D. In a modern family it is often mothers who are responsible for raising a child.
10. Which one is the best title of the passage?
A. Confusion Behind “Where are we going, dad?”
B. Modern Education is Important
C. Nanny Daddy and Cute Kids
D. New problems in Modern Children’s Education
11 What attitude towards modern family education does the author express in the second paragraph?
   A. Proud.       	B. Optimistic.		C. Worried. 	   	D. Doubtful.

D
It's puzzling, isn't it? No matter where you try to tickle  (使人发痒)  yourself, even on the soles  (脚底)  of your feet or under your arms, you just can't.
To understand why, you need to know more about how your brain works. One of its main tasks is to try to make good guesses about what's going to happen next. While you're busy getting on with your life, walking downstairs or eating your breakfast, parts of your brain are always trying to predict the future.
Remember when you first learned how to ride a bicycle? At first, it took a lot of concentration to keep the handlebars steady and push the pedals (踏板) . But after a while, cycling became easy. Now you're not aware of the movements you make to keep the bike going.From experience, your brain knows exactly what to expect, so your body rides the bike automatically. Your brain is predicting all the movements you need to make.
You only have to think consciously about cycling if something changes---like if there's a strong wind or you get a flat tyre. When something unexpected happens like this, your brain is forced to change its predictions about what will happen next. If it does its job well, you'll adjust to the strong wind, leaning your body so you don't fall.
Why is it so important for our brains to predict what will happen next? It helps us make fewer mistakes and can even save our lives. For example, when a chief fireman sees a fire, he immediately makes decisions about how best to position his men. His past experiences help him foresee what might happen and choose the best plan for fighting the fire. His brain can instantly predict how different plans would work out, and he can rule out any bad or dangerous plans without putting his men at risk in real life.
     So how does all this answer your question about tickling, kids? Because your brain is  always predicting your own actions, and how your body will feel, as a result, you cannot tickle yourself. Other people can tickle you because they can surprise you. You can't predict what their tickling actions will be.
12. What is the best title for this passage?
A. Why Can't I Tickle Myself ?  				B. The Secret of Cycling.
C. How Does the Brain work?				D. The Importance of Prediction
13. We can infer from Paragraph 4 that_______.
A. it's nothing serious to get a flat tyre.
B. prediction can be changeable and adaptable.
C. weather changes can be predicted by brain.
D. it's dangerous to cycle in the strong wind.
14. The phrase "rule out" in Paragraph 5 probably means “________”.
A. make rules of		B. think about		C. get rid of		D. carry on
15. The passage is probably taken from             .
A. a research paper for doctors			B a guidebook for passengers
C. a scientific report for experts			D. a science book for children

It may have happened to you. Your friend comes back from his travels, gives you a gift, and you think to yourself “he bought this at the airport gift shop”. But every traveling gift-shopper means well!    16    If you’re traveling and buying gifts soon, try these tips.
    Support local artists. One thing that is sure to be original is art from local artists.  17    Check out his work. It might show the scenery and history of the place you are visiting. Your friends will love this.
       18   If you see locals who have obviously just done a little shopping, ask them where they went! Ask them what they simply cannot live without in their particular hometown. This could be a special kitchen tool, shoes meant for a sport that is unique in that area, even a bottle of the local’s favorite wine.
    Make your videos.    19    But think of your parents, grandparents, even brothers or sisters who you don’t see often and who are always asking you to write or call more. Don’t just shoot your weekly email or make that monthly call.    20   
    Souvenir shops are the last places for real souvenirs. The only tip you might get from a souvenir shop is that you notice a certain place on many of the postcards. If you see this, ask the shopkeeper where that place is, go there and get a souvenir.
A. Follow that shopping bag.
B. They just don’t know where to find the most meaningful gifts.
C. These may not be necessary for your friends.
D. Send them a video and they will instantly feel close to you.
E. If you come across an artist selling his work in the street, don’t pass by quickly.
F. The gift will come with a great story.
G. You might find something that to you seems interestingly new.

When I was 8 years old, a gentleman came to my orphanage（孤儿院）and taught us how to do woodworking projects.
I remember my first project—a small table. I was so   21  of it that I looked upon it as if I had created a(an)   22 . It was absolutely beautiful and it had taken me six weeks to  23   it. I could hardly wait to give it to Mother Winters as a   24  . She was the head mistress of our orphanage, who was always   25  with us.
As the tables were not dry from the clear coating, the man told us to wait a few days before taking them to our dormitories. But I was just so   26   and happy that I couldn’t wait. I _27_ out like a flash, carrying my table and smiling from ear to ear.
When I reached the dormitory I placed the little table beside my bed. I was   28   it when Mother Winters entered. She walked over to the table. Running her hand   29   it, she noticed that it was still wet. 
“Were you   30   to bring this home?” she asked.
“No, ma’am,” I   31   with my head down.
She ordered me to throw the table out and so I did. After she left, I immediately opened the door to get it back. There was   32   stuck all over. I brushed and cried, but it would not come off.

I just came back from Britain last week. I was luckily enough to be one of the students from different country to visit the UK from Feb. 16 to 28. We paid a visit to a good many of places, like London, Oxford or the Lake District. I learned much about British culture and history in London, where was my favorite.

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am Li Hua. I am a student in Class 1, Grade 3. I have read the notice that our school radio station needs two English announcers, so I’m writing to introduce myself.
First of all, I am greatly interested in broadcasting. I have received some professional training in my spare time, hoping that I can work as an announcer in the future. Now I would like to put what I have learned into practice and gain some experience. Besides, I am good at English, especially spoken English. I won first prize in the English Speech Competition last year. So I think I am highly qualified for the job. If I am admitted, I will try my best to serve the students. I sincerely hope that you can give me a chance to work for the school radio station.
I am looking forward to your early reply.
                                                                    Yours,

A
                               Games in Class
       Playing computer games is getting serious. Washington teacher Tammie Schrader is so enthusiastic about computer games in education that she thinks they can be used to teach programming skills which will help students in college——starting in middle school.
       Canadian teacher Justin Holladay wrote a few simple games to help his students practice math skills, and when they caught on, he started his own company to create more of them.
       And the University of Washington’s Zoran Popovic got more than 4,000 Washington students to master their lessons this spring by playing a computer game for just a few hours.
       The growing availability of inexpensive tablet computers and a new generation of young teachers who grew up playing on computers have spurred (激发)interest in games for serious purposes.
       “Six or seven years ago, selling games to schools was forbidden,” said David Martz of Muzzy Lane Software, a Boston, US company that produces games for publishers such as McCraw-Hill. Now, he said, schools are interested in the promise of games—perhaps because gaming is so much more popular.
       Software and education companies have tried for many years to combine youngsters’ passion for computer games with educational progress, without much success.
       Popovic thinks the first effort to combine games with education fell flat because they were created by commercial companies. These companies were more interested in selling products than seeing students master a skill.
       Teachers say there are some pretty good games in the marketplace now.
       Holladay, the math teacher from Alberta, Canada, began moving paper-based math games to the iPad, building games that allowed students to compete with each other and giving them instant feedback(反馈) on their progress.
       The game reinforced(加强)the lessons he was teaching, and his students had fun playing, he said. “They were a lot more engaged.”
21. What factors have helped promote computer games in schools according to the article?
a. The affordability of tablet computers.
b. The preferences of young teachers.
c. The advertisements of commercial companies.
d. Parents’ support.
e. Better games being produced.
A. a,b,c               B. a,c,d                C. a,b,e              D. b,d,e
22. What is Holladay’s attitude towards the idea of using computer games in class?
A. It allows students to learn in a fun way.
B. It is not as helpful as people thought it would be.
C. It reduces the interaction between teachers and students.
D. It sounds good but it makes it inconvenient for teachers to get feedback from students.
23. The writer’s attitude towards the use of computer games for education is          .
A. objective            B.  negative             C. critical              D. supportive.
B
      Christmas Eve was tomorrow. I hoped one of the packages that held a camera had already been placed under the Christmas tree. It was the only thing I wanted. I had been dropping hints to my parents. I love taking photos. My bedroom walls are covered with photos I had taken with my mom’s old camera. I’m always trying to capture (捕捉) those perfect moments in which you can hear the laughter or touch the beautiful scene, but my camera has always seemed to fall short. 
       I knew Mom had put a few presents under the tree this morning, so I went on a hunt in my mom’s room. I opened the door and found my Christmas present was lying unwrapped on the floor — a big pink cat. I felt so disappointed.
       Mom seemed to notice that, and she tried to cheer me up. “Stacy, I got your present today. I am so excited to surprise you!” “I can’t wait,” I said. The next day I couldn’t wait any longer. I needed to tell her.
 “Mom, may I talk to you for a second?” 
“Sure, dear. What do you need to talk about?” she asked.
And so it came — how upset I was that I was getting a cat. 
“Stacy, that cat is for your sister Julia!” she said with a smile.
“Then what am I getting?” I asked.
She just smiled. “You’ll have to wait and see.” 
       Next morning, I happily got into the living room and sat next to the tree. I pulled out the box with my name on it and opened the wrapping paper to find ...
        My camera! “Thank you!” I said to both Dad and Mom.
 Dad picked up the camera and took a picture of Julia, Mom and me. It has become one of my favorite pictures. Just on that Christmas morning, I took lots of photos with my camera — my little sister making a face, my parents giving me a soft smile — and all of these photos have come to mean one thing to me: love.
24. The underlined phrase “dropping hints” in Para-graph 1 means _____.
A. talking often        B. suggesting indirectly
C. sending presents     D. taking pictures
25. Why did Stacy feel disappointed at first?
A. Her mother couldn’t understand her at all.
B. Her mother didn’t buy her any Christmas gift.
C. She mistook her sister’s Christmas gift for hers.
D. She didn’t find her present in her mom’s room.
26. We can learn from the passage that _____.
A. her mother bought Stacy a camera after discovering her disappointment
B. her mother knew what gift Stacy wanted for Christmas
C. Stacy thought it’s OK to have an old camera
D. Stacy finally got her gift on Christmas Eve
27. What would be the best title for the passage?
A. A Christmas gift as wished     B. Love is more important than gifts
C. A wonderful Christmas.       D. Love can not be bought
C
      The Peales were a famous family of American artists．Charles Willson Peale is best remembered for his portraits of leading figures of the American Revolution．He painted portraits(肖像) of Franklin and Jefferson and over a dozen of George Washington．His life-size portrait of his sons Raphaelle and Titian was so realistic that George Washington reportedly once tipped his hat to the figures in the picture．
       Charles Willson Peale gave up painting in his middle age and devoted his life to the Peale museum, which he founded in Philadelphia．The world’s first popular museum of art and natural science mainly covered paintings by Peale and his family as well as displays of animals in their natural settings．Peale found the animals himself and found a method to make the exhibits more lifelike．The museum’s most popular display was the skeleton （骷髅） of a huge, extinct elephant, which Peale unearthed on a New York farm in 1801．
       Three of Peale’s seventeen children were also famous artists．Raphaelle Peale often painted still lives of flowers, fruit, and cheese．His brother Rembrandt studied under his father and painted portraits of many noted people, including one of George Washington．Another brother, Rubens Peale, painted   mostly landscapes and portraits．
       James Peale, the brother of Charles Willson Peale, specialized in miniatures （小画像）．His daughter Sarah Miriam Peale was probably the first professional female portrait painter in America．

    Your house may have an effect on your figure. experts say the way you design your home could play a role in whether you pack on the pounds or keep them off. you can make your environment work for you instead of against you. Here are some ways to turn your home into part of your diet plan.
Open the curtains and turn up the lights. dark environments are more likely to encourage overeating, for people are often less self-conscious(难为情) when they’re in poorly lit places – and so more likely to eat lots of food. If your home doesn’t have enough window light, get more lamps and flood the place with brightness.
    Mind the colors. Research suggests warm colors fuel our appetites. In one study, people who ate meals in a blue room consumed 33 percent less than those in a yellow or red room. Warm colors like yellow make food appear more appetizing, while cold colors make us less hungry. So when it’s time to repaint, go blue.
    Don’t forget the clock – or the radio. People who eat slowly tend to consume about 70 fewer calories(卡路里) per meal than those who rush through their meals. Begin keeping track of the time, and try to make dinner last at 30 minutes. And while you’re at it, actually sit down to eat. If you need some help slowing down, turning on relaxing music. It makes you less likely to rush through a meal.
    Downsize the dishes. Big serving bowls and plants can easily makes us fat. We eat about 22 percent more when using a 12-inch plate instead of a 10-inch plate. When we choose a large spoon over a smaller one, total intake(摄入) jumps by 14 percent. And we’ll pour about 30 percent more liquid into a short, wide glass than a tall, skinny glass.
32. The text is especially helpful for those who care about ____.
A. their home comforts
B. their body shape
C. house buying
D. healthy diets
33. A home environment in blue can help people ____.
A. digest food better    B. reduce food intake  C. burn more calories  D. regain their appetites
34. What are people advised to do at mealtimes?
A. Eat quickly.                               B. Play fast music
C. Use smaller spoons                         D. Turn down the lights
35. What can be a suitable title for the text?
A. Is Your House Making You Fat?              B. Ways of Serving Dinner
C. Effects of Self-Consciousness                D. Is Your Home Environment Relaxing?

第二节：作文
It is obvious that if we would like to achieve success in something, we are supposed to develop interest in it. Only when we are interested in what we do will we be able to devote ourselves to working hard.
I will share my own experience with you. As is known to us , it is not unusual that math is a great barring to girls. Thus, after failing in the math exams over and over again, I lost interest in it completely. Luckily, my math teacher told me never to give up and helped me, which made me crazy about learning it. Gradually, my interest in math developed, little by little, which made me willing to spend much time bearing in mind the basic rules and do more basic math exercises every day. Meanwhile, it equipped me with determination and courage for removing all obstacles to improving my math. Eventually, I became the top student in math in my class.
Based on what I have gone through, we can draw a conclusion that great importance should be attached to interest to have access to success. It is interest that inspires us to reach our aim。

Twin sisters are supposed to be very much alike, are they not? Well, my twin sister Jane and I do look alike. However, we are different in many ways. I care little about clothes. T-shirts and blue jeans are my favorite clothes. My sister often dresses like a model. We have very similar characters in most ways. I don’t get angry and enjoy being with friends. In this respect, my twin sister feels the same. But she likes loud music and modern dances while I find that nightclubs give me a headache. She is always with friends, is the favorite of our teachers and never wants to have children. I prefer to be alone at times, don’t really try to please my teachers and want some day to have a family of my own. We have tried to live in the same room several times and even agreed on the color we like best and the kind of furniture we want. But I like to keep things neat and orderly while my twin sister acts as if there were a servant around to pick up all the things that get thrown on the floor. I like to go to bed early and get up early. She often goes to bed very late and then sleeps late next day.

A
Have you ever heard of an old saying? Intelligence is a born ability while goodness is a choice. Gifts are easy – they’re given after all. Choice can be hard.
I got the idea to start Amazon 16 years ago. I came across the fact that the Internet usage was growing at 2300 percent per year. I'd never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast, and the idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles was very exciting to me. I had just turned 30 years old, and I’d been married for a year. I told my wife MacKenzie that I wanted to quit my job and go to do this crazy thing that probably wouldn’t work since most start-ups don’t and I wasn’t sure what to expect. MacKenzie told me I should go for it. As a young boy, I’d been a garage inventor. I’d always wanted to be an inventor, and she wanted me to follow my passion.
I was working at a financial firm in New York City with a bunch of very smart people and I had a brilliant boss that I much admired. I went to my boss and told him I wanted to start a company selling books on the Internet. He took me on a long walk in Central Park, listened carefully to me, and finally said, “That sounds like a really good idea, but it would be an even better idea for someone who didn’t already have a good job.” That logic made some sense to me, and he convinced me to think about it for 48 hours before making a final decision. Seen in that light, it really was a difficult choice, but finally, I decided I had to give it a shot. I didn’t think I’d regret trying and failing. And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all.
After much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I’m proud of that choice. For all of us, in the end, we are our choice．
2l.What inspired the author with the idea of building an online bookstore?
A. His dream of being an inventor.
B. The support of his wife.
C. The greatly increasing usage of the Internet.
D. Millions of exciting titles.
22. Which of the following is closest in meaning to the underlined sentence?
A. The idea of not trying would keep coming to his mind and disturb him.
B. He would be very excited if he tried it out.
C. He would be always having a doubt if he didn’t try.
D. The decision to not try the online bookstore would terrify him.
23. Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?
A Cleverness and Kindness
B. The Starting of Amazon
C. Following My Passion
D. We Are What We Choose
24. We can know from the passage that_______
A. the boss thought the idea was suitable for the author
B. the author wanted someone else to try the idea
C. the author might not regret if he failed the idea
D. the author might go back to his boss if he failed

                                B
With the development of modern society, human beings are increasingly invading wild animals’ habitat as well as the wild plants’. Nearly a third of the world’s cacti (仙人掌 ) are facing the threat of extinction, according to a shocking global assessment of the effects. 
Cacti are an important provider of food and water to desert wildlife ranging from wolves and deer to tortoises, bats and birds, and these fauna spread the plants’ seeds in return. 
But the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)’s first worldwide health check of the plants says that they are coming under huge pressure from human activities such as land use changes, commercial and residential developments and shrimp farming. But the paper said the driver of cacti species extinction was the “uncontrolled collection of live plants and private decorating collections, and annual agriculture.” 
The findings were described as “disturbing” by Inger Anderson, the IUCN’s director-general. “They confirm that the scale of the illegal wildlife trade, including the trade in plants is much greater than we had previously thought, and that wildlife illegal trade concerns many more species than the elephants which tend to receive global attention.” 
Cacti are almost always delicious but unlike most others, they store water in their stems alone, enabling them to survive extreme draughts. The plants can be as small as one centimeter in diameter and grow above 19 meters in height. Well over half of the species are used by humans for display decoration, food or medicine. Almost 1,500 types of cacti were surveyed by the IUCN specialists over a five-year period, mostly in America.
Dealing with the illegal trade is a hard task as they can be hidden in suitcases or even socks. While countries such as Peru have made progress in blocking the illegal trade, the IUCN is calling for more strictly carrying out the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) in the “hotspots” of Uruguay, Brazil and Chile. Mexico has made advances but still has work to do, according to Goettsch.
25. What does the third paragraph mainly tell us?
A. What causes cacti species extinction   B. What gives people pressure
C. What IUCN has found              D. What farmers have planted
26. In Inger Anderson’s opinion, ________.
Á. the findings of the IUCN are not disturbing
B. the illegal plant trade is less serious than we had thought
C. cacti have received much global attention
D. the illegal plant trade threatens lots of wildlife
27. Why is it hard to fight against cacti trade?
A. Because cacti can be made into socks.
B. Because cacti are easy to carry secretly.
C. Because many countries carry out Cites strictly.
D. Because some countries made advances to trade cacti.

C
It is widely acknowledged that nearly every kid might come across some kind of school bullying, however, the age at which kids first fall victim to bullying (欺侮) could influence how strongly they are affected, suggests a new study. And, surprisingly, it is not the youngest kids who are hurt the most in the long term.
Bullying can have long-lasting effects, but particularly when it begins in adolescence, the researchers say. people subjected to either verbal ( 口头的) or physical bullying are known to be at greater risk of developing depression, anxiety disorders or to behave violently. But not everyone reacts in this way.
Children bullied for the first time before they hit adolescence seem to get over it, but those who are bullied for the first time later on in adolescence seem to become more aggressive or are more likely to turn to drink as the conclusions of psychologist Matthew Newman and colleagues of Texas at Austin, US. 
The team gave questionnaires to nearly 1,500 college students regarding their experience of physical and psychological bullying before adolescence- before high school- and in late adolescence- at high school. They assessed mood and mental state, judging by signs of anxiety or depression, such as sleeplessness. The group was also questioned about how they would react to certain challenges, such as humiliation.
People who were bullied all revealed slightly higher levels of stress. But while those bullied earlier in life seemed to respond normally to provocation (煽动), people bullied for the first time late in adolescence are more withdrawn and sensitive to violence.
There are also sex differences between those bullied for the first time during adolescence, with females more likely to react aggressively when provoked and males are much more likely to turn to alcohol to escape bad situations. The best solution in all cases was strong social support, whether from friends, family or school. Those with no one to share their problems with suffered the most.
So perhaps it is best not to shelter children completely from bullying early on, suggests Newman “They may get stressed, but unhealthy coping really jumps out when they are bullied for the first time later on.”

28. What determines the degree of bullying’s effect on people according to the study?
A. The reason why they are bullied.
B. The place where they are first bullied.
C. The age at which they are first bullied.
D. The person who first bullies them.
29. What may happen to those first bullied later on in adolescence according to Newman and his colleagues?
A. Some are likely to be more aggressive.
B. They seem to easily get over the effect of bullying.
C. Most of them will respond to bullying normally.
D. Most of them are afraid of sharing their problems.
30. What does the underlined word “humiliation” in Paragraph 4 mean?
A. Carrying out an important plan.    
B. Being made to feel ashamed
C. Trying hard to survive an accident.
D. Feeling hopeless in an emergency. 
31. The sex differences between people bullied for the first time during adolescence are reflected in _______.
A. the support they get from the society
B. the effect bullying has on them 
C. the way they react to provocation 
D. the type of bullying they receive

    阅读下列材料，在空白处填入适当的单词或用括号内单词的正确形式填空。
Were you the first or the last child in your family? Or were you a middle or an only child? Some people think  61  matters where you were born in your family. But there are different ideas about what birth order means. Some people say that oldest children,  62   are smart and strong-willed, are very likely  63    (succeed). The reason   64   this is simple. Parents have a lot of time for their first child and give him or her a lot of attention. An only child will succeed for  65  same reason. 
What happens to the  66  children in the family? Middle children don’t get so much attention, so they don’t feel that important. If a family has many children, the middle one sometimes gets lost in the crowd. The youngest child,  67  , often gets special treatment. Often this child grows up to be funny. But a recent study saw things quite   68   (difference). The study found that first children believed in family rules. They didn’t take many chances in   69    lives. They usually   70    (follow) orders. Rules didn’t mean as much to later children in the family. They took chances and they often did better in life.

第二节 书面表达
Dear John，
I heard that you would like to hold an art exhibition for children. I’m glad to hear this and I want to give you some suggestions that I think may help. 
First, why not choose a theme attracting children’s attention since it is mainly aimed at children? It is also a good choice to exhibit some paintings drawn by children. If they can see their own or their peers’ works on show, they might be more interested in it. What’s more, it would be better to display some paintings of famous artists so as to guide children to appreciate the beauty of these paintings. Meanwhile, you can pick out some inspiring stories of these famous artists to encourage children to continue painting. 
That’s what I want to say. I hope your exhibition will be a complete success. 
 
Yours，
Li Hua

A
Each morning Grandpa was up early sitting at the kitchen table, reading his book. His grandson wanted to be just like him and tried to copy him in every way he could.
One day the grandson asked, “Grandpa, I try to read the book just like you, but I don’t understand it, and I forget what I understand as soon as I close the book. What good does reading the book do?”
The grandpa quietly turned from putting coal in the stove and replied, “Take this coal basket down to the river and bring me back a basket of water.”
The boy did as he was told, but all the water leaked out before he got back to the house. The grandpa laughed and said, “You’ll have to move a little faster next time,” and sent him back to the river with the basket to try again.
This time the boy ran faster, but again the basket was empty before he returned. Out of breath, he told his grandpa that it was impossible to carry water in a basket, so he went to get a bucket instead.
The grandpa said, “I don’t want a bucket of water; I want a basket of water. You’re just not trying hard enough.”
The boy again dipped the basket into the river and ran hard, but when he reached his grandpa the basket was empty again. Out of breath, he said, “Grandpa, it’s useless!”
“So, you think it is useless?” the grandpa said, “Look at the basket.”
The boy looked at the basket and for the first time he realized that the basket was different. It had been transformed from a dirty old coal basket and was now clean. 
“Grandson, that’s what happens when you read the book. You might not understand or remember everything, but when you read it, you’ll be changed, inside and out.”
21. What puzzled the grandson most was ________.
   A. why he forgot what he read soon
   B. whether it was useful to read books
C. what kind of book he could understand
D. how he could read books like his grandpa
22. Why did Grandpa ask his grandson to fetch a basket of water?
A. To get him to realize the use of reading books.
B. To punish him for not reading carefully.
C. To clean the dirty basket in the river.
D. To train him to run faster.
23. What lesson can we learn from the story?
A. The old are always wiser than the young.
B. It is foolish to carry water with a basket.
C. You can’t expect to remember all you read.
D. Reading books can change a person gradually.
24. What can be the best title for the text?
A. Grandpa and grandson
B. Carrying water in a basket
C. Baskets and books
D. Reading for total changing
B
There is a famous story about British poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. He was writing a poem when he was interrupted by a knock at the door.
This was an age before telephones. Someone was delivering a message. When Coleridge got back to his poem, he had lost his inspiration. His poetic mood had been broken by the knock on his door. His unfinished poem, which could otherwise have been a masterpiece, would now never be more than a fragment.
This story tells how unexpected communication can destroy an important thought, which brings us to the cell phone.
The most common complaint about cell phones is that people talk on them to the annoyance of people around them. But more damaging may be the cell phone’s interruption of our thoughts.
We have already entered a golden age of little white lies about our cell phones, and this is by and large(大体上)a healthy, protective development. “I didn’t hear it ring” or “I didn’t realize my phone had shut off” are among the lies we tell to give ourselves space where we’re beyond reach.
The notion of being unreachable is not a new concept—we have “Do Not Disturb” sign on the doors of hotel rooms. So why must we feel guilty when it comes to cell phones? Why must we apologize if we decide to shut off the phone for a while?
Now time alone, or a conversation with someone next to us which cannot be interrupted by a phone, is something to be cherished. Even cell phone devotees（信徒）, myself usually included, can’t help at times wanting to throw their phones away, or curse(咒骂) the day they were invented.
But we don’t and won’t, and there really is no need. All that’s required to take back our private time is a general social recognition that we have the right to it. In other words, we have to develop a healthy contempt (轻视)for the rings of our own phones.
A cell phone call deserves no greater priority than a random word from the person next to us，though the call on my cell phone may be the one-in-a-million from Steven Spielberg—who has finally read my novel and wants to make it his next movie. But most likely it is not, and I’m better off thinking about the idea I just had for a new story, or the slice of pizza I’ll eat for lunch.
25. What is the point of the anecdote about the poet Coleridge in the first three paragraphs?
A．To emphasize the disadvantage of not having a cell phone.
B．To encourage readers to read the works of this poet.
C．To show how important inspiration is to a poet.
D．To direct readers’ attention to the main topic.
26. What does the writer think about people telling “white lies” about their cell phones?
A．It is a way of signaling that you don’t like the caller.
B．It is basically a good way to protect one’s privacy.
C．We should feel guilty when we can’t tell the truth.
D．It is natural to tell lies about small things.
27. According to the author, what is the most annoying problem caused by cell phones?
A．Cell phones interrupt people’s private time.
B．With cell phones it is no longer possible to be unreachable.
C．People feel guilty when they are not able to answer their cell phones.
D．People get so obsessed (着迷) with the cell phone rings that they fail to notice anything else.
28. What does the last paragraph imply?
A．Never let cell phones disturb your life too much.
B．A person who calls us from afar deserves more of our attention.
C．Steven Spielberg once called the author to talk about the author’s novel.
D．You should always finish your lunch before you answer a call on the cell phone.
C
Dear all,
    Please read Professor Hume’s email about his next lecture on Rosa Parks.
                                           Susan Miller
Secretary
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Susan,
Please forward this message to students of my history class. 
Besides the life story of Rosa Parks in the textbook, the students are also required to read the passage below and some related stories that can be borrowed from the school library.
                                                    Ted Hume
The early experiences of Rosa Parks(1913-2005), long known as the “mother of the civil rights movement,” were not different from those of many African-Americans at that time. The black woman, however, turned the course of American history in December 1955 when she refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man. “By sitting down, ” remarked John Lewis, “She was standing up for all Americans.” 
Among the numerous awards Parks received in her life were the Presidential Medal of Freedom(1996) and the Congressional Gold Medal(1999).
Parks died on Oct. 24, 2005. At St. Paul A.M.E. Church in Montgomery, a large crowd including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice celebrated her life. Rice said she and others, who grew up when the political activities of Parks held public attention, might not have realized her impact on their lives, “but I can honestly say that without Mrs. Parks, I probably would not be standing here as Secretary of State.” 
After her casket(灵柩) was placed at the Capitol, U.S. President Bush, members of Congress and ordinary Americans paid their respects. In American history Parks is the first woman to lie in state at the Capitol, a very high regard usually reserved for Presidents of the United States.
    29. What is the main purpose of Susan’s email?
A．To introduce to the students Rosa Parks.
B．To help the students organize a lecture.
C．To answer Professor Hume’s last email.
D．To make arrangements for Professor Hume’s class.
    30. What does the underlined word “forward” mean?
A．Read.   B. Explain.    C. Send.    D. Take.
    31. The political impact of Rosa Parks lies in the fact that she ___________.
A．joined the civil rights movement at a young age.
B．made racial equality a common value in American society.
C．helped Condoleezza Rice achieve political success.
D．set a good example in her early life for other black Americans.
    32. How was Rosa Parks treated after her death?
A．She was honored to lie in state at the Capitol.
B．She was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
C．She was received by President Bush at the Capitol.
D．She was named “mother of the civil rights movements.”

YOU CAN'T DO IT EVEN IF IT HURTS NOBODY
Who do you think breaks the law in our society? If you believe that only tough guys commit crimes, you may have to think again. Unlike in the movies, we can't divide the world into bad guys and model citizens. Real life is much more complex. In the same way that diseases range from the common cold to fatal forms of cancer, crimes vary in degree. For example, smoking in an elevator will inconvenience people, but much less than threatening them with a gun.
In addition to breaking the law themselves, people tolerate various levels of crime. Why can we tolerate some crimes? It may be that, by seeing others do something, we accept it more easily. For instance, most people will find it easier to speed on a highway when everybody else is driving over the speed limit. When people celebrate a sports championship, if they see someone breaking store windows, they might start breaking windows themselves or even steal from the store. So the people around us influence how much law-breaking we can tolerate.
We must also wonder whether seeing violence on television or reading about it in the newspapers every day makes us tolerate crime more than we should. We become used to seeing blood on the news on television, or in full color in newspapers and magazines. Because we see thousands of dead people on TV, maybe we just try to ignore the situation behind the violence .If so many citizens tolerate violence and crime, or even commit crimes themselves, it may simply be because of the human mind. Our minds may not care about specific laws. Instead, our minds may have a system of values that usually prevents us from hurting other people to improve our own lives. Yet, when it comes to respecting the rights of a mass of anonymous (不知名的)individuals, we might not be so responsible. While most people would not steal a wallet containing $50，they may not mind cheating on taxes, because cheating on taxes does not hurt anyone person. It hurts society, but "society" remains an abstract idea that is not as real as a neighbor or a friend's friend.
When we realize that many people have misunderstandings of law-breaking, we could think it is surprising that so many people have a criminal record. How could we improve the level of honesty in our society? Would strict laws help make our society better? Probably not. Honesty will have to come from social pressure: in the family, at school, on the job, each and every one of us can encourage honesty by showing which behavior is unacceptable. And teaching respect should  become everyone's responsibility.
33. According to the author, "Real life is much more complex." probably means  ______.
   A. smoking in an elevator goes against laws in the real life
   B. there is a wide range of people and crimes in the real life
   C. there are much more crimes than diseases in the real life
   D. some model citizens sometimes break laws in the real life
34. People tolerate violence and crime because  ______.
   A. they hold mistaken beliefs about law-breaking

Muzak
The next time you go into a bank, a store, or a supermarket, stop and listen. What do you hear?   36   It’s similar to the music you listen to, but it’s not exactly the same. That’s because this music was especially designed to relax you, or to give you extra energy. Sometimes you don’t even realize the music is playing, but you react to the music anyway.
Quiet background music used to be called “elevator music” because we often heard it in elevators. But lately we hear it in more and more places, and it has a new name “Muzak”. About one-third of the people in America listen to “Muzak” every day. The music plays for 15 minutes at a time, with short pauses in between. It is always more lively between ten and eleven in the morning, and between three and four in the afternoon, when people are more tired.  37  .    
If you listen to Muzak carefully, you will probably recognize the names of many of the songs. Some musicians or songwriters don’t want their songs to be used as Muzak, but others are happy when their songs are chosen. Why?   38  .    
Music is often played in public places because it is designed to make people feel less lonely when they are in an airport or a hotel. It has been proven that Muzak does what it is designed to do. Tired office workers suddenly have more energy when they hear the pleasant sound of Muzak in the background.  39  . Supermarket shoppers buy 38 percent more groceries.
       40   . They say it’s boring to hear the same songs all the time. But other people enjoy hearing Muzak in public places. They say it helps them relax and feel calm. One way or another, Muzak affects everyone. Some farmers even say their cows give more milk when they hear Muzak!
A. Muzak is played in most of the big supermarkets in the world.
B. They get as much as $4 million a year if their songs are used.
C. The music gives them extra energy.
D. Muzak tends to help people understand music better.
E. Factory workers produce 13 percent more.
F. Music is playing in the background.
G. Some people don't like Muzak.

A
Who’s in control of your life? Who is pulling your string? For the majority of us, it’s other people—society, colleagues, friends, family or our religious community. We learned this way of operating when we were very young, of course. We were brainwashed. We discovered that feeling important and feeling accepted was a nice experience and so we learned to do everything we could to make other people like us. As Oscar Wilde puts it, “Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else’s opinions, their lives a mimicry(模仿), their passions a quotation.”
So when people tell us how wonderful we are, it makes us feel good. We long for this good feeling like a drug. Therefore, we are so eager for the approval of others that we live unhappy and limited lives, failing to do the things we really want to. Just as drug addicts and alcoholics live worsened lives to keep getting their fix (一剂毒品). We worsen our own existence to get our own constant fix of approval.
But, just as with any drug, there is a price to pay. The price of the approval drug is freedom—the freedom to be ourselves. The truth is that we cannot control what other people think. People have their own agenda, and they come with their own baggage and, in the end, they're more interested in themselves than in you. Furthermore, if we try to live by the opinions of others, we will build our life on sinking sand. Everyone has a different way of thinking, and people change their opinions allthe time. The person who tries to please everyone will only end up getting exhausted and probably pleasing no one in the process.
So how can we take back control? I think there’s only one way—make a conscious decision to stop caring what other people think. We should guide ourselves by means of a set of values---not values imposed（强加）from the outside by others, but innate values which come from within. If we are driven by these values and not by the changing opinions and value systems of others, we will live a more authentic, effective, purposeful and happy life.

21．What Oscar Wilde says implies that _____________.
A. most people’s thoughts are controlled by others
B. most people have a variety of thoughts
C. we have thoughts similar to those of others
D. other people’s thoughts are more important
22．What does the author try to argue in the third paragraph ?
A. We need to pay for what we want to get.
B. Changing opinions may cost us our freedom.
C. We may lose ourselves to please others.
D. The price of taking drugs is freedom.
23． In order to live a happy, effective and purposeful life, we should _________.
A. care about others’ opinions and change opinions all the time
B. guide ourselves by means of values from the outside
C. stick to our own values
D. persuade others to accept our opinions
24．It can be concluded from the passage that __________.
A. it’s important to accept others’ opinions
B. it’s better to do what we like
C. we shouldn't change our own opinions
D. we shouldn’t care what others think too much

Thousands of taxi drivers in Shenyang, Liaoning province, reportedly blocked streets with their vehicles on Sunday in protest against unlicensed vehicles using taxi-hiring apps (打车软件) and apps-based car rental companies providing passenger services, including high-end cars. Although the drivers also complained about the withdrawal of the fuel subsidy by the government, their main complaint was the loss of business because of the rising number of Internet-based car services companies.
On Wednesday, news reports came that Beijing transport authorities will take measures to stop the illegal “taxi business” of private cars through the newly rising Internet apps, following the footsteps of Shenyang and Nanjing.
It is not yet clear how the Shenyang city government will handle the issue and whether it will declare the services offered by market leaders such as Didi Dache, a taxi-hiring app provider backed by Tencent Holdings, and Kuaidi Dache illegal. But Shanghai transport regulators have set a rule, by banning Didi Zhuanche, or car services offered by Didi Dache in December.
Such regulations will cause a setback to the car-hiring companies and investors that are waiting to cash in on the potentially booming business. Just last month, Didi Dache got $700 million in funding from global investors, including Singapore state investment company Temasek Holdings, Russian investment company DST Global and Tencent. Besides, the market is uncertain that Kuaidi Dache is about to finalize its latest round of funding after getting $800 million from global investors.
Regulatory uncertainties, however, could cast a shadow on the future of the Internet-based car-hiring services, which have become popular in most of China’s big cities. To be fair, these companies’ business model is anything but bad. For example, Didi Zhuanche works side by side with established car rental companies to provide high-end car service mainly for businesspeople through the Internet and mobile phone apps.
Every link in this business model chain has legal companies and services. Hence, it is hard to define it as illegal and ban it.
28．Why did taxi drivers in Shenyang block the streets with their vehicles?
A. Because they wanted the authority to increase their driving allowances.
B. Because they wanted to be taught how to use the taxi-hiring apps.
C. Because they wanted to make their main complaints known to the authority.
D. Because they wanted to appeal to passengers not to hire the private cars.
29．The author’s attitude to banning internet car-hiring service is______.
A. positive        B. negative      C. neutral         D. unclear
30．Which of the following statements is false according to the passage?
A. The problem referred to in the passage exists in all cities
B. App-based car rental is functional to some degree
C. The government should regulate the app-based car rental market
D. Didi Dache is a China-foreign joint company
31．we can learn from the passage that _____.
A. Shenyang forbade apps-based car rental companies
B. Shanghai is the second city banning Didi Zhuanche
C. some international investment companies have strong faith in the future of apps-based car rental companies
D. it is not difficult to picture the apps-based car rental companies illegal

                               
D
Generally speaking, government regulations normally ban anything from smoking in public places to parking in certain zones. But officials in the Brazilian town of Biritiba Mirim, 70km (45miles) east of Sao Paulo, have gone far beyond that. They plan to prohibit residents from dying early because the local cemetery(墓地) has reached full capacity.
There’s no more room to bury the dead, they can’t be cremated(火化) and laws forbid a new cemetery. So the mayor has proposed a strange solution: outlaw death. Mayor Roberto Pereira says the bill is meant as a protest against federal regulations that prohibit new or expanded cemeteries in preservation areas. “They have not taken local demands into consideration”, he claims.
A 2003 decree(法令) by Brazil’s National Environment Council forbids burial grounds in protected areas. Mr. Pereira wants to build a new cemetery, but the project has been stopped because 98% of Biritiba Mirim is considered as a preservation area.
Biritiba Mirim, a town of 28,000 inhabitants, not only wants to prohibit residents from passing away. The bill also calls on people to take care of their health in order to avoid death. “I haven’t got a job, nor am I healthy. And now they say I can’t die. That’s ridiculous,” Amarido do Prado, an unemployed resident said.
The city council is expected to vote on the regulation next week. “Of course the bill is laughable, illegal, and will never be approved,” said Gilson Soares de Campos, an assistant of the mayor. “But can you think of a better resolution to persuade the government to change the environmental decree that is prohibiting us from building a new cemetery?” The bill states that “offenders will be held responsible for their acts.” However, it does not say what the punishment will be.

32．What is the bill to be proposed by the officials in Biritiba Mirim?
A. Ban on building a new cemetery.
B. Ban on parking in certain zones.
C. Forbidding buried grounds in preservation.
D. Prohibiting residents from dying early.
33．What can we infer from the phrase “have gone far beyond that” in the first paragraph?
A. The officials in Biritiba Mirim have made these regulations.
B. The officials in Biritiba Mirim have been to many places around the world.
C. The bill to be proposed by officials in Biritiba Mirim is much too unexpected.
D. The officials in Biritiba Mirim have built too many cemeteries in their town.
34．What’s the attitude of the mayor of Biritiba Mirim towards the federal regulations?
A. He remains silent about them.
B. He gives strong backing to them.
C. He objects to them.
D. He asks the residents for advice on them.
35．Which of the following is TRUE according to the text?
A. The mayor of the town wants to build a new cemetery against federal regulation.
B. The residents of the town sing high praise for the bill.
C. No better resolution of the problems has been thought out.
D. The government is going to change the environmental decree.

A major source of teen stress is school exams, and test anxiety is not uncommon. When you recognize your teen is under stress, how can parents help your teen stay calm before an exam?
Be involved. Parents need to be involved in their teen’s work.   36  What they look for is your presence — to talk, to cry, or simply to sit with them quietly. Communicate openly with your teen. Encourage your teen to express her worries and fears, but don’t let them focus on those fears.
Help them get organized.   37    Together , you and your teen can work out a time—table in which she can study for what she knows will be on the test.
Provide a calm setting. Help your teen set up a quiet place to study and protect his privacy. Give them a nutritious diet. It is important for your teen to eat a healthy, balanced diet during exam times to focus and do her best.   38     If this happens, encourage your teen to eat light meals or sandwiches. A healthy diet, rather than junk food, is best for reducing stress.
  39   Persuade your teenager to get some sleep and /or do something active when she needs a real break from studying. Making time for relaxation, fun, and exercise are all important in reducing stress. Help your teen balance her time so that she will feel comfortable taking time out from studying to spend time with friends or rest.
Show a positive attitude.   40   Your panic, anxiety and blame contribute to your teen’s pressure. Make your teen feel accepted and valued for her efforts. Most importantly, reassure your teen that things will be all right, no matter what the results are.
A. A parent’s attitude will affect their teen’s emotions.
B. Exam stress can make some teens lose their appetite.
C. They will only make the situation worse.
D. Encourage your teen to relax.

Last Christmas while staying with my parents, I  41  across some old love letters that my parents wrote to each other. These letters were all piled up in a basket, dirty and  42 with dust. Deciding to read and sort them, I asked them if I could take the letters back to my Illinois home. They  43  .
As I carefully opened each letter,  44  of them fragile with age, I discovered a new page  45  unknown to me in this private chapter of my parents' lives.

Just six weeks after our Christmas visit, Daddy became very   49   and was hospitalized. This time, he was fighting a   50   kind of war. As I sat by his bedside, we discussed the   51  . He told me how much receiving those lipstick-kissed letters had  52  to him when he had been so far from home.
It so happened that the next day would be February 14. From the   53   letters I chose the card my father had sent Mother in 1944 and brought it to my father’s bedside.
At his bedside, I talked with him, saying   54  , "Today is Valentine's Day, don’t you want to send Mother a present?" He became   55   when I handed him the old   56  . He carefully opened it and took out the card, and when he  57   it, his eyes were filled with tears.
My father, in a  58   tight with emotion (情感) read the loving message he'd sent to my mother fifty-six years  59  . And this time, he could read it to her in  60  .

参考范文
Dear Jane,
I am sorry to hear that you didn’t do well in maths and have lost interest in schoolwork. In my opinion, maths is difficult for most students, so there is no need to feel too bad. At this moment, you should cheer up and find ways to reduce your anxiety. Why not go on an outing with your friends or find time to listen to your favorite music? If you can talk to the teachers who you respect most, they may give you some practical advice that helps you to improve. Probably it’s time for you to explore a new learning method which is better and more suitable for you.
Anyway, I hope you can rebuild your self-confidence soon!
                                                       Yours,
                                                       Li Fang

The Great Gatsby, Lord of the Flies, and The Catcher in the Rye ... these books are usually among the reading lists given to students in the US. They all have something in common – the writers are all white men. As the literary ideas taught in today’s schools are often the groundwork for further education, critics believe that reading mostly white male views could have negative effects on students.
  Scott Campbell, an English teacher at New Trier High School, said he believes this fact comes from social oppression (压迫).
  “Women a hundred or so years ago were not encouraged or expected that they might write, so we’re left with literature that seems unbalanced,” Campbell explained. “This is just one of the after-effects of male domination (统治).”
  Some schools have started to change that. Hancock High School in Michigan has included books that teachers believe to be more culturally relevant to their students. Themes have included power and justice (正义), family and women’s rights, which are taught through The Kite Runner and The Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts respectively (分别地).
  Hancock junior Sandra Rodriguez said she welcomes her school’s efforts to replace some of the traditional high school reads.
  “These books just talk about men and men and men. And they never actually show women actually doing something,” she said. “You have to read something you feel good about.”
  Still, some students warn that there’s a fine line between a curriculum (课程) that reflects their culture and one that’s trying too hard.
  “We come from a Hispanic (拉美的) culture, but even when they give us ‘Hispanic books’, it’s like the same book over and over: Hispanic kid wants to go into the white community and not get looked down upon,” said Hancock senior Lisseth Perez.
24.Why do the reading lists for American students need improving?
    A. the literary ideas stated in the books of the lists are out of date
    B. the lists overemphasize the topic of social oppression
    C. the lists are dominated by the works of white male authors
    D. the lists don't contain any works by modern writers
25. According to the passage, what kind of novel is the The Kite Runner?
A.Valuable family values
B. the theme of the power and justice
C. Equal rights for men and women
D. Huge changes in the Hispanic community
26.What did Lisseth Perez think of the "Hispanic books"on her reading list?
A. exciting
B. boring
C. inspiring
D. Confusing
27. What do the books in the reading lists for American students have in common?
    A. They are about power and justice
    B. They are about families and women’s rights
    C. They are about social oppression
    D. The authors are white men

Hu Li's heart sank due to the color of the air. Driving 140 kilometers from Tianjin City to Beijing last week，she held her breath as the air became a charcoal grey haze(炭灰色的阴霾)．The 39­year­old businesswoman has lived in Beijing for a decade，and this past month，she said，brought the worst air pollution she has ever seen. It gave her husband a cough and left her seven­year­old daughter housebound(足不出户)．“My husband as well as I is working here，so we have no choice，” she said.“But if we had a choice，we'd like to escape from Beijing.”
The extended heavy pollution over the last month，which caused punishment in return for a day last week－called the “airpocalypse” by internet users－ has largely changed the way that Chinese think about the country's air. On one day，pollution levels were 30 times higher than levels considered safe by the World Health Organization (WHO)．Flights were cancelled. Roads were closed. One hospital in east Beijing reported they had treated more than 900 children for breathing issues. Bloomberg found that for most of January，Beijing's air was worse than that of an airport smoking area.
The smog's(烟雾) most threatening aspect is its high concentration(浓度) of PM 2.5 － particulate matter that is small enough to breathe deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream，causing breathing infections，lung cancer and possibly damaging children's development. The WHO has estimated that outdoor air pollution accounts for two million deaths per year，65% of them in Asia.
28．Which conclusion can we draw from the first paragraph?
A．Hu Li is living in Beijing.				B．Hu Li traveled to Tianjin for business.
C．The haze is harmful to people.				D．The pollution is the worst in Beijing's history.
29．The haze affected people mainly in________．
A．the way they traveled					B．the opinion about national air
C．the way they lived their life				D．the life style of internet
30．From the passage we know high concentration of PM 2.5________．
A．can lead to choke						B．can cause heart cancer 
C．will damage children's development		D．will damage people's organ
31．What's the best title for the passage?
A．Hu Li's attitudes to Beijing's haze			B．The damages of Beijing's haze
C．WHO suggests improving Beijing's air		D．What caused air pollution in Beijing
                                   

                                           D
    Do you believe that things are connected for no scientific reason at all? For example, do you avoid saying the word “four” to avoid bad luck? If so, you have a superstition (迷信). And you’re not alone – all kinds of people have them.
   For example, Portugal’s soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo always steps onto the pitch (球场) with his right foot first, according to The Telegraph. And sports players are not alone in having superstitions. A visitor once asked the Nobel Prize winning scientist Niels Bohr whether he really believed that the horseshoe he’d hung at his country home was lucky. “Of course not,” the Danish physicist said. “But I understand it’s lucky whether you believe in it or not.”
   One recent study found that even scientists at MIT and other top US schools tended to look for a meaning in natural events, similar to the connection between stepping on the pitch and playing soccer well, according to The Atlantic. When the researchers gave the scientists little time to answer questions, they were twice as likely to agree with statements such as “Trees produce oxygen so that animals can breathe” than they were when they had more time to think about their reply.
   It seems that fear can make people think differently in this way, too. In a British study, students imagined meeting a “witch” who said she would cast (施魔法) an evil spell on them. About half said a scientist should not be worried about the spell. Yet each of them said that, personally, they wouldn’t let the “witch” do it to them.
   So why are so many of us superstitious? Well, it seems to be our way of dealing with the unknown. “Many people quite simply just want to believe,” Brian Cronk, a professor of psychology at Missouri Western State University, said in a 2008 interview. “The human brain is always trying to work out why things happen, and when the reason is not clear, we tend to make up some pretty bizarre (古怪的) explanations.”
  And these explanations aren’t completely unhelpful. In fact, superstitions can sometimes work and bring real luck, according to psychologists at the University of Cologne in Germany in the May 2010 issue of the journal Psychological Science. They found that believing in something can improve performance on a task like an exam.
  So, what about you? What superstitions do you follow to keep you safe and successful?
32. Why does the author mention word "four" in the first paragraph?
A. to prove that it is reasonable to be superstitious
B. to introduce the readers to the topic of superstitions
C. to show how foolish it is to believe in superstitions
D. to discuss the scientific reasons behind superstitions
33.How many examples of superstitions are mentioned in the passage? 
A. 2       		B. 3      			C. 4          			D.5
34.What’s the author’s attitude to superstitions?
A. Neutral       B. Positive         	C. Negative     			D. Unknown
35. What is the best title of the article?
A. How to get rid of superstitions
B. How superstitions affect our daily lives
C. How some common superstitions came into being
D. Why superstitions are common

 “Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.” — Lao Tzu
    If you are in a city where everyone rushes, realize that you don’t have to be like everyone else. You can be different. You can walk instead of driving in rush hour traffic. You can be on your iPhone or Blackberry less, and disconnected sometimes. Your environment doesn’t control your life — you do. I’m not going to tell you how to give you a step-by-step guide to moving slower. _36__
1. Do less.
Cut back on your projects, on your task list, on how much you try to do each day. Focus not on quantity but on quality. _37_ Save smaller, routine tasks for later in the day, but give yourself time to focus.
2. Have fewer meetings.
__38__ And they eat into your day, forcing you to squeeze the things you really need to do into small windows, and making you rush.
3. _39_ 
   When you do the important things with focus, without rush, there will be things that get pushed back, and that don’t get done. And you need to ask yourself: how necessary are these things? What would happen if I stopped doing them?
4. Practice mindfulness.
   	Simply learn to live in the present, rather than things so much about future or the past. When you eat, fully appreciate your food. When you are with someone, be with them fully. When you are walking, appreciate your surroundings, no matter where you are.
Try these things out. Life is better when unrushed.   __40__
A. Start to put off or cancel the unnecessary.
B. Meetings are usually a “big waste of time”.
C. The world likely won’t end if you don’t pass one of the examinations.
D. But here are some things to consider and perhaps adopt, if they work for your life.
E. Remember the quote: if nature can get everything done without rushing, so can you.
F. Pick 2-3 important things — or even just one important thing — and work on those first.
G. Give yourself more time to get ready and get there.

One spring afternoon in 1983, I stopped a taxi in Kuala Lumpur. I __52__ my destination. The driver acknowledged my __53__ but did not move off. Instead, he looked __54__ at me. “Raddar？”he said, using my childhood nickname(绰号)．I was astonished at being so __55__ addressed (称呼). Unexpectedly! It was Ismail! Even after two __56__ we still recognized each other. Grasping his shoulder, I felt a true affection, something __57__ to describe.
If we can allow our children to be __58__ without prejudice, they'll build friendships with people, regardless of race or religion, who will be __59__ their side through thick and thin.

Dear Peter, 
I am writing to ask that you are able to do me a favor. I want to have a pen friend, hopefully, a girl in her early twenties, and with interests similarly to mine. In my mind, he is someone interesting in traveling, swimming, and playing table tennis. However, it would be better for her to have a pet dog as I have been kept one at home for some time. With such a pen friend, I hope I can share with her our experiences in traveling, taking care pets, or whatever we have in common. I believed I will improve my English by doing so and learn more about her countries. I am looking forward to hear from you soon.

My friends, Emma Daniels, spent the summer of 1974 traveling in Israel. During her monthlong stay in Jerusalem she often went to a café called Chocolate Soup. It was run by two men, one of whom – Alex – used to live in Montreal. One morning when Emma went in for coffee, while chatting with her new friend Alex, she mentioned that she had just finished the book she was reading and had nothing else to read. Alex said he had a wonderful book she might like, and that he’d be happy to lend it to her. As he lived just above the café, he quickly ran up to get it. The book he handed to Emma just minutes later was Markings, a book by a former Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN).

   When I learned that my 71-year-old mother was playing Scrabble – a word game – against herself, I knew I had to do something. My husband suggested we give her a computer to play against. I wasn’t sure my mother was ready for it. After all, it had taken 10 years to persuade her to buy an electric cooker. Even so, we packed up our old computer and delivered it to my parents’ home. And so began my mother’s adventure in the world of computers.
  It also marked the beginning of an unusual teaching task for me. I’ve taught people of all ages, but I never thought I would be teaching my mother how to do anything. She has been the one teaching me all my life: to cool and sew; to enjoy the good times and put up with the bad. Now it was my turn to give something back. w.w.w.zxxk.c.o.m
   It wasn’t easy at the beginning. There was so much to explain and to introduce. Slowly but surely, my mother caught on, making notes in a little notebook. After a few months of Scrabble and other games, I decided it was time to introduce her to word processing. This proved to be a bigger challenge to her, so I gave her some homework I asked her to write me a letter, using different letter types, colors and spaces.
  “Are you this demanding with your kindergarten pupils?” she asked.
  “No, of course not,” I said. “They already know how to use a computer.”
  My mother isn’t the only one experiencing a fast personal growth period. Thanks to the computer, my father has finally got over his phone allergy. For as long as I can remember, any time I called, my mother would answer. Dad and I have had more phone conversations in the last two months than we’ve had in the past 20 years. w.w.w.zxxk.c.o.m

A. She is a cook.                   B. She is a teacher.
C. She is a housewife.              D. She is a computer engineer.
30. The author decided to give her mother a computer            .
A. to let her have more chances to write letters
B. to support her in doing her homework
C. to help her through the bad times
D. to make her life more enjoyable
31. The author asked her mother to write her a letter                .
A. because her mother had stopped using the telephone
B. because she wanted to keep in touch with her mother

D. so that mother could be free from housework

   When asked to point out one or two things that are most important to themselves, many put friends ahead of homes, jobs, clothes and cars.
  A true friendship carries a long history of experience that determines who we are and keeps us connected. It is a treasure we should prove it. Unfortunately, the better friends you are, the more probably you’ll have disagreements. And the result can be what you don’t want an end to the relationship.
The good news is that most troubled friendships can be mended. First, don’t let your pride get in your way. Most of us can forgive each other when differences are brought out in the open. Second, apologize when you’re wrong – even if you’ve been wronged. Over the course of friendship, even the best people make mistakes. Sometimes, it may be best if the wronged person takes wrong. Third, see things from your friend’s point of view. And finally, accept that friendships changes as our needs and lifestyles change. Making friends can sometimes seem easy.  The hard part is keeping the connections strong during the nature ups and downs that have an effect on all relationships. My suggestion: Consider friendship an honor and a gift, and worth the effort to treasure and nurture. w.w.w.zxxk.c.o.m
33. What would be the best title for the text?
A. Easy Ways to Make Friends      
B. Ups and Downs in Friendship

A.we have much in common           
B. we know our friends mistakes
C.we treat our disagreements wisely

This morning I got up early and went to school as usually, only to find there were nobody in the classroom because it is Sunday. “How a bad memory I have!” I couldn’t help laughing. Stand in front of the school gate, I began to wonder what to do next. Suddenly a good idea occurs to me. “Why not get together with some good friends for a picnic in such fine weather?” I immediately telephoned some of my best friends, but they all agreed to join me. About two hours late, we finally arrived a pleasant park with trees and flowers here and there. We really enjoyed us greatly.

One possible version:
As a middle school student, it is necessary to build a good relationship with our teachers, for it is the teachers who show love and concern for us students in study and life and they are good listeners. We students can always seek support and advice from them, from which we can benefit and learn a lot.
   Therefore an ideal relationship between teachers and students is very important. In my opinion, this relationship should be one filled with love, care, understanding, and respect, so we can exchange ideas freely. To build a relationship of this kind, teachers should become friends of students while students ought to trust our teachers and express our feeling frankly. Only by joint efforts can we enjoy a friendly relationship between teachers and students.

“A person’s a person, no matter how small,”Theodor Seuss Geisel, Dr. Seuss, would say. “Children want the same things we want. To laugh, to be challenged, to be entertained and delighted.”
Brilliant, humorous, and always respectful of children, Dr. Seuss charmed four generations of youngsters and parents. In the process, he helped millions of kids learn to read. 
Dr. Seuss was born Theodor Geisel in Springfield, Massachusetts, on March 2, 1904. After graduating from Dartmouth College in 1925, he went to Oxford University, intending to acquire a doctor’s degree in literature. At Oxford, Geisel met Helen Palmer, whom he married in 1927. Upon his return to America later that year, Geisel published cartoons and humorous article for Judge, the leading humor magazine in America at that time. His cartoons also appeared in major magazines such as Life, Vanity fair, and Liberty. Geisel gained national exposure when he won an advertising contract for an insecticide called Flit. He coined the phrase”Quick, Henry, the Flit!”, which became a popular expression.
Geisel published his first children’s book, And to Think That I saw It on Mulberry Street, in 1937 after 27 publishers rejected it.
He began to work as Dr. Seuss on illustrated literature, mostly children’s literature, in the late 1930s, publishing the books And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street(1937), The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins(1938), The King’s Stilts(1939), The seven Lady Godivas(1939), and Horton Hatches the Egg(1940).
As the winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1984, an Academy Award, three Emmy Awards, three Grammy Awards, and three Galdecott Honors, Geisel wrote and illustrated 44 books. While Theodor Geisel died on September 24, 1991, Dr Seuss lives on, inspiring generations of children of all ages to explore the joys of reading.
    25. From the first two paragraphs, we can tell Dr.Seuss ______.
    A. showed great respect for children.
    B. used to be a teacher.
    C. was very kind and generous.
    D. wrote books for children.
    26. The underlined part “gained national exposure”in the third paragraph can be explained as “______.”
    A. was exposed to advertising.
    B. learned a lot about advertising.
    C. become famous in the USA.
    D. earned a lot of money.
    27. According to the passage, And to Think That I saw It on Mulberry Street ______.
    A. was published in 1939.
    B. is Geisel’s second children’s book
    C. won Geisel the Pulizer Prize.
    D. had been rejected 27 times before being published.
    28. What can be inferred from the last paragraph ?
    A. Geisel wrote 44 books in his life.
    B. Thedor Geisel died at the age of 90.
    C. Dr. Seuss’s children’s books must sell very well.
    D. Theodor Geisel won awards 5 times.
C
 Scientists have discovered a real-life “moral compass” in the brain that controls how we judge other people’s behavior. The region, which lies just behind the right ear, becomes more active when we think about other people’s misdemeanor or good works. 
In an experiment, researchers were able to use powerful magnets to disturb this area of the brain and make people temporarily less moral. The study discovers that our sense of right and wrong isn’t just based on upbringing, religion or philosophy —but also by the biology of our brains. 
The researchers used a non-invasive technique to disrupt the area of the brain. The technique generates a magnetic field on a small part of the skull which creates weak electric currents in the brain. These currents interfere(干扰) with nearby brain cells and prevent them from firing normally. 
One story described a man who let his girlfriend walk over a bridge he knew was unsafe. The girl survived unharmed. Under normal conditions, most people rate the man’s behavior as unacceptable. But after getting the magnetic pulse, the volunteers tended to see nothing wrong with his actions—and judged his behavior purely on whether his girlfriend survived. 
Another story described two girls visiting a chemical plant where one girl asks her friend to put sugar in her coffee. The friend uses powder from a jar marked toxic (有毒的) —but as the powder turns out to be sugar. Volunteers with a disrupted moral compass tended to rate the girl’s behavior as permissible because her friend was not injured —even though she was aware the powder came from a jar labeled toxic. 
Throughout the experiment, irresponsible or deliberate actions that might have resulted in harm were seen as morally acceptable if the story had a “happy ending”. 
    29. What’s the probable meaning of the underlined word “misdemeanor” in Paragraph 1?
    A. Behavior
    B. Misdeed
    C. Fate
    D. Adaption
30. The third paragraph mainly tells us ______.
A. how the powerful magnets disrupt the area of the brain
B. what harm the powerful magnets bring to the brain
C. whether the powerful magnets can disrupt the area
D. how researchers spot the area with powerful magnets
31. What do the two stories want to tell us?
A. People who like playing jokes on others is controlled by “moral compass”.
B. People judge others’ behavior acceptable or not by the “moral compass”.
C. Whether people’s behavior is acceptable or not is judged by a happy ending. 
D. Different behavior controlled by the “moral compass” are all acceptable. 
 D
Most people have some common sense. When we see something suspicious on TV, in the newspaper, or on the Internet, we roll our eyes and wonder how anyone could believe something so stupid. Nevertheless, there are stories that even educated people still believe. These tales may or may not be true, but they leave us wondering whether they are real or not. On National Geographic Channel, these stories are dissected(剖析) in full detail in the series Is It Real.
Thousands of years ago, aliens landed on the Earth. They tampered (破坏) with the evolution of humans and the results of this can be seen practically everywhere. Sound ridiculous? Not to some people. Believe it or not, there are those who believe that alien astronauts had a hand in making the human race what it is today. Travel back in time with Ancient Astronauts and visit our “alien ancestors”.
In the autumn of 1888, Jack the Ripper roamed(漫游) the streets of London’s East End. After his reign(统治) of terror was over, five women had been killed. To this day, the mystery of who killed these ladies remains unsolved. No one knows for sure, but the truth may be revealed on Jack the Ripper. 
Vampires(吸血鬼). Just the thought of these fictional beasts is enough to make your blood run cold. While we may think that they only come to life in books and movies, vampires are actually based on real people. Historians, folklorists, scientists and doctors all work together to investigate the plausibility(似乎合理) of vampires. Take a bite into this juicy mystery on Vampires.
No other channel can offer this type of programming other than National Geographic Channel. In this unique series, they’ve stripped away 12 myths that have stood the test of time to expose the truth and find out the answer to the question—Is it real?
32. What type of person would believe these stories?
A. Anyone with a fear of ghosts. 
B. A person without any common sense
C. Anyone with a bit of imagination
D. Only educated people. 
33. Who was Jack the Ripper?
A. A notorious actor in London’s East End theater district. 
B. The name of a traveler to London’s East End. 
C. The name given to an unknown murderer. 
D. The serial killer of hundreds of women in the 1800s. 
34. The truth about Vampires may be known because ______.
A. a novelist is looking into it
B. different people in different fields are weighing in on it
C. there’s new evidence that can prove their existence
D. National Geographic Channel knows the truth
35. What is the purpose of this series?
A. To uncover the details about a series of murders.
B. To solve well-known crimes.

Dear Mr. Smith,
How are you? Today I’ve got a wonderful news to tell you. I have been offered a scholarship at a university in Australian for my further education. One hundred and twenty students took exams for it, but only a few was chosen and I was one of them. Therefore, my parents are not happy about it. They are strong against me going there. They say it is too far away that they will not see me for a whole year and they are afraid I will feel alone. They can’t imagine a girl so young live alone. They advise me to study in the capital instead. Then I ’ll be able to continue living with them. How can I persuade him to accept the fact I have grown up ?
Yours sincerely, 
Li Hua.

It’s great to receive your e-mail. Now I’d like to tell you something that took place in my school on the 4th day of May.
On that day, we held a growing up ceremony for our coming 18-year-old birthday. At first we made an oath that as grown-ups we should have a sense of duty for our society from now on. Then we showed our thanks to our parents who had gone through hardships to bring us up and teachers who have been educating us patiently. And our teachers also gave us cards expressing their good wishes to us. Finally, we put on wonderful performances, singing and dancing.
I think it’s very important for us. I will remember the day in my life.

阅读下列短文，从每题所给的四个选项（A、B、C、和D）中，选出最佳选项，并在答题卡上将该项涂黑。
A
Still seeking a destination for your weekend break? There are some places which are probably a mere walk away from your college.
King’s Art Centre
A day at the Centre could mean a visit to an exhibition of the work of one of the most interesting contemporary artists on show anywhere. This weekend sees the opening of an exhibition of four local artists.
You could attend a class teaching you how to “learn from the masters” or get more creative with paint ---- free of charge.
The Centre also runs two life drawing classes for which there is a small fee.
The Botanic Garden
The Garden has over 8,000 plant species; it holds the research and teaching collection of living plants for Cambridge University.
The multi-branched Torch Aloe here is impressive. The African plant produces red flowers above blue-green leaves, and is not one to miss.
Get to the display house to see Dionaea muscipula, a plant more commonly known as the Venus Flytrap that feeds on insects and other small animals.
The Garden is also a place for wildlife-enthusiasts. Look for grass snakes in the lake. A snake called “Hissing Sid” is regularly seen lying in the heat of the warm sun.
Byron’s Pool
Many stories surround Lord Byron’s time as a student of Cambridge University, Arriving in 1805, he wrote a letter complaining that it was a place of “mess and drunkenness”. However, it seems as though Byron did manage to pass the time pleasantly enough. I’m not just talking about the pet bear he kept in his rooms. He spent a great deal of time walking in the village.
It is also said that on occasion Byron swam naked by moonlight in the lake, which is now known as Byron’s Pool. A couple of miles past Grantchester in the south Cambridgeshire countryside, the pool is surrounded by beautiful circular paths around the fields. The cries of invisible birds make the trip a lovely experience and on the way home you can drop into the village for afternoon tea. If you don’t trust me, then perhaps you’ll take it from Virginia Woolf ---- over a century after Byron, she reportedly took a trip to swim in the same pool.
21. The main idea of this passage is _____.
A. some places for weekend break
B. interesting stories about Lord Byron
C. an approach to becoming creative in art
D. the colorful life in the countryside
22. “Torch Aloe” and “Venus Flytrap” are_____.
A.common insects	B.impressive plants 
C.rarely-seen snakes	D.wildlife-enthusiasts
23. The author’s purpose in mentioning Virginia Woolf is to show _____.
A. she was a famous writer	B. she was keen on swimming
C. she was Byron’s admirer	D. Byron’s Pool is a pleasant place

B
Alexis, 17, sat quietly in the passenger seat of her dad’s car. She let her eyes lazily scan the landscape for wildlife. Then a deer came into view about 200 yards in front of them. “Dad, there’s a deer there!” Alexis said. It was a male deer with sharp antlers (角) on each side of its head.
As the car moved closer, Alexis saw that the deer’s head was bent toward the ground. Then she heard a scream and saw an arm fly up near the deer’s head. Alexis realized the deer was attacking a woman. Sue, a 44-year-old mother, had been out for her morning run. The deer followed her and edged closer. “I knew I was in trouble,” Sue says. She went to pick up a stick for self-defense, and the deer charged. It lifted her with its antlers and threw her into the air. Sue could feel blood flew down her leg. Within seconds, the deer had pushed her off the road.
When Alexis and her father pulled up, the deer was throwing Sue like a doll. Alexis looked into the woman’s terrified eyes, and before her father had even stopped the car, the teenager jumped quickly out of the car and ran toward the deer. “I was kicking it to get its attention,” she says. Then her father,who had followed his daughter, pushed the deer away from the women.
Alexis helped Sue into the car, and then applied a piece of cloth to Sue’s injured leg. “We’re going to get you to a hospital,” Alexis said. Then she heard her father shout loudly. He had been knocked to the ground. Alexis took hold of a hammer from the car and ran to where her father lay on his back. She beat the deer’s head and neck, but the blows didn’t scare it away. “I was losing faith,” she says. “A couple more strikes, Alexis,” said her father. “You can do it.”
Turning the hammer around, Alexis closed her eyes and beat the deer’s neck with all her strength. When she opened her eyes, the deer was running away.
Alexis got in the driver’s seat and sped toward the nearest hospital. After Sue was treated, she tearfully thanked her rescuers. “You expect a teenage girl to get on the phone and call for help,” she says, “not to beat up a deer.”
24.What was Sue doing when she was attacked by the deer?
A .She was driving home.	B. She was resting on the road.
C. She was taking exercise.	D. She was feeding wild animals.
25. What did Alexis do to save Sue?
A. She pushed the deer away.	B. She hit the deer with her feet
C. She drove the car to hit the deer.	D. She beat the deer with a hammer.
26. Which of the following words can best describe Alexis?
A. Brave.	B. Cruel.	C. Energetic.	D. Strong.
27. What is the best title for the passage?
A. A Woman Was Seriously Injured
B. A Dangerous Deer Attacked a Woman
C. A Girl Rescued Her Father Successfully
D. A Teenager Saved Others from a Deer Attack

C
No one would much like the idea of eating 61 pounds of tomatoes a day. But if their goodness was put into an easy-to-swallow pill that you were told might prevent strokes(中风) and heart attacks you would probably be putting in an order tomorrow.
Researchers believe they may have come up with just that after trials. The daily pill contains a chemical called lycopene which makes tomatoes red and is known to break down fat in the vessels(血管). A Cambridge University study found taking the pills improved blood flow and the lining of vessels in patients with pre-existing heart conditions. It also increased the flexibility(灵活性) of their vessels by 50 percent. The scientists believe it could limit the damage caused by heart disease--responsible for 180,000 deaths a year--and help cut the 49,000 deaths a year from strokes. They also hope it could benefit those with arthritis(关节炎), diabetes(糖尿病) and even slow the progress of cancer.
Each pill is equal to eating around 61 pounds of ripe tomatoes. Studies have shown eating a Mediterranean-style diet rich in tomatoes fish, vegetables, nuts and olive oil can significantly reduce cholesterol(胆固醇) and help prevent cardiovascular disease.
Preliminary results from a two-month trial, in which the pill was given to 36 heart disease patients and 36 healthy volunteers with an average age of 67, were presented at a meeting of the American Heart Association. It was shown to improve the function of the endothelium -- the layer of cells lining blood vessels. It also improved their sensitivity to nitric oxide, the gas which causes the enlargement of the vessels in response to exercise. 
Ian Wilkinson, head of Cambridge University’s clinical trials unit, said “These results are potentially very significant and it meets the goal, but we need more trials to see if they translate into fewer heart attacks and strokes.”
Further studies are planned, with researchers hoping it could offer a choice for heart disease sufferers who can not take the cholesterol-lowing drugs.
Mike Knapton, head of the British Heart Foundation, said, “Although this showed lycopene improved blood flow in people with heart disease, that’s a long way from demonstrating that taking it could improve outcomes for people with heart disease. The best way to get the benefits of a good diet is to eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables.”
28. What can we infer from Paragraph 1?
A. We can eat too much tomato food.
B. Tomatoes are helpful to strokes and heart attacks.
C. Tomatoes will lose healthy elements when put into pills.
D. We had better not eat tomatoes.
29. We can learn from the passage that the pills_________.
A. are at the experiment stage
B. can cure all the disease
C. are widely used among patients
D. cost patients so little money
30. Who were the volunteers by taking part in the trial?
A. Children.	B. Youth. 
C. Working people.	D. Old healthy people.
31. What was Ian Wilkinson’s opinion on the trial?
A. Surprising.	B. Disappointing. 	C. Satisfactory. 	D. Terrible.

D
“Heaven (天堂) is where the police are English, the cooks are French, the mechanics are German, the lovers are Italian and everything is organized by the Swiss. Hell (地狱) is where the police are German, the cooks are English, the mechanics are French, the lovers are Swiss, and everything is organized by the Italians.”
Obviously the national stereotypes (模式化的思想) in this old joke are generalizations (普遍化), but such stereotypes are often said to “exist for a reason”. Is there actually a sliver (裂片) of truth in them? Not likely, an international research team now says.
“National and cultural stereotypes do play an important role in how people see themselves and others, and being aware that these are not dependable is a useful thing,” said study author Robert McCrae of the National Institute on Aging. “These are in fact unfounded stereotypes. They don’t come from looking around you,” McCrae said.
If national stereotypes aren’t rooted in real experiences, then where do they come from? One possibility is that they reflect national values, which may become known from historical events. For example, many historians have argued that the spirit of American individualism (个人主义) has its origins in the experiences of the pioneers on the Old West.
Social scientists such as psychologist Richard Robins have given several other possible explanations for stereotypes and why they may be incorrect. Robins notes that some stereotypes may have been correct at one point in history and then remained unchanged while the culture changed.
We may be “hard-wired”, to some degree, to keep incorrect stereotypes, since we are less likely to notice and remember information that is different from our stereotypes. Generally, according to Robins, when we meet people who are different from our stereotypes, we see them as unique individuals rather than typical national or cultural groups.
32. The stereotype about Italians is ______.
A. strict but thoughtful	B. friendly and good-tempered
C. dreamy and impractical	D. romantic but disorganized 
33. National stereotypes are not always correct because______.
A. they are formed by individual historians
B. people tend to have false idea about other cultures
C. what was true in the past may not be true at the present
D. generalizations are made through personal experience
34. According to the research team led by McCrae, national stereotypes are ______.
A. unreliable	B. harmful	C. humorous	D. interesting
35. The underlined word “hard-wired” in the last paragraph probably means______.
A. anxious	B. fixed	C. helpless 	D. forgetful

根据短文内容，从短文后的选项中选出能填入空白处的最佳选项，选项中有两项为多余选项。
Handwriting can make or break the first impression. If your handwriting is difficult for others to read, you will sometimes feel embarrassed.   36   It needs lot of practice to improve your handwriting.
37   Try each of them out on a piece of paper by signing your name. Find out which type of pen you can write best with. You may be amazed at the change in your handwriting just by changing to another pen.
38   Do not just do what feels comfortable because that is just your old bad habit coming back into play. Try to hold the pen lightly and don’t press too hard.

My mother was a responsible teacher and she retired. So I decided to give her one of my old computers to help her pass the time. She had a little bit of computer    41  , so I just set it up for her and let her   42   with it on her own. 
As time went on, I   43   the computer was hardly touched. She said she didn’t know how to use it. I decided to teach her. I sat and   44   everything and she seemed OK with what I said.   45   , my sister called me at that moment    46   we talked on the phone for an hour. Then when I saw her again, she was sitting in front of the computer, looking quite   47  . The screen saver (屏幕保护) had appeared and she didn’t know how to   48  it off. She had tried   49   every key and it didn’t work. I told her, “Just   50   the mouse a little.” What I meant was that she just needed to move the mouse around to   51   the computer up. What she did was to   52   the mouse and start shaking it around in mid-air until the   53   went completely black. I couldn’t help laughing because of her funny   54  . The more I laughed the   55  she got.
She thought that I was a (n)   56   teacher and she decided to figure the thing out herself. Well, at least I helped her overcome her   57   of breaking something and encouraged her to   58   a little.
About a week later, I found a home-made   59   card with a mouse on the front making a funny face  60  to my door. It said, “Thanks for the computer lessons. Love, Mom.”

Last weekend’s concert, organized and performing by the students of the Welsh Community College, was great success. The student had been practicing for months for the concert. They were excited that when they heard Gareth Jones was coming to present the prizes. Over 100 young performers play a mixture of jazz, classical or folk music. One of the highlights were 14-year-old Megan Evans, playing traditional Welsh folk songs. The concert ended with a very loud pop tune and anyone in the hall stood up and danced with the music. It was a magically atmosphere and a wonderful evening.

Minutes after the last movie ended yesterday at the Plaza Theater, employees were busy sweeping up popcorns and gathering coke cups. It was a scene that had been repeated many times in the theater’s 75-year history. This time, however, the cleanup was a little different. As one group of workers carried out the rubbish, another group began removing seats and other theater equipment in preparation for the building’s end.
The film classic The Last Picture Show was the last movie shown in the old theater. Though the movie is 30 years old, most of the 250 seats were filled with teary-eyed audience wanting to say good-bye to the old building. Theater owner Ed Bradford said he chose the movie because it seemed appropriate. The movie is set in a small town where the only movie theater is preparing to close down.
Bradford said that large modern theaters in the city made it impossible for the Plaza to compete. He added that the theater’s location(位置) was also a reason. “This used to be the center of town,” he said. “Now the area is mostly office buildings and warehouse.”
Last week some city officials suggested the city might be interested in turning the old theater into a museum and public meeting place. However, these plans were abandoned because of financial problems. Bradford sold the building and land to a local development firm, which plans to build a shopping complex on the land where the theater is located.
    The theater audience said good-bye as Bradford locked the doors for the last time. After 75 years the Plaza Theater had shown its last movie. The theater will be missed.
24. In what way was yesterday’s cleanup at the Plaza special?
.  A. It made room for new equipment.   
  B. It signaled the closedown of the theater.
  C. It was done with the help of the audience.
  D. It marked the 75th anniversary of the theater. 
25. Why was The Last Picture Show put on?
  A. It was an all-time classic.             B. It was about the history of the town.
  C. The audience requested it.            D. The theater owner found it suitable.
    26. What will probably happen to the building?
  A. It will be repaired.                  B. It will be turned into a museum.
  C. It will be knocked down.            D. It will be sold to the city government.
    27. What can we infer about the audience?
  A. They are disappointed with Bradford.  
  B. They are sad to part with the old theater.
  C. They are supportive of the city officials.
  D. They are eager to have a shopping center.
C
After years of heated debate, gray wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park. Fourteen wolves were caught in Canada and transported to the park. By last year, the Yellowstone wolf population had grown to more than 170 wolves.
Gray wolves once were seen here and there in the Yellowstone area and much of the continental United States, but they were gradually displaced by human development. By the 1920s, wolves had practically disappeared from the Yellowstone area. They went farther north into the deep forests of Canada, where there were fewer humans around.
The disappearance of the wolves had many unexpected results. Deer and elk populations—major food sources(来源) for the wolf—grew rapidly. These animals consumed large amounts of vegetation(植被), which reduced plant diversity in the park. In the absence of wolves, coyote populations also grew quickly. The coyotes killed a large percentage of the park’s red foxes, and completely drove away the park’s beavers.
As early as 1966, biologists asked the government to consider reintroducing wolves to Yellowstone Park. They hoped that wolves would be able to control the elk and coyote problems. Many farmers opposed the plan because they feared that wolves would kill their farm animals or pets.
The government spent nearly 30 years coming up with a plan to reintroduce the wolves. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service carefully monitors and manages the wolf packs in Yellowstone. Today, the debate continues over how well the gray wolf is fitting in at Yellowstone. Elk, deer, and coyote populations are down, while beavers and red foxes have made a comeback. The Yellowstone wolf project has been a valuable experiment to help biologists decide whether to reintroduce wolves to other parts of the country as well.
    28. What is the text mainly about?
   A. Wildlife research in the United States.  
   B. Plant diversity in the Yellowstone area.
   C. The conflict between farmers and gray wolves.
   D. The reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone Park.
    29. What does the underlined word “displaced”in paragraph 2 mean?
   A. Tested          B. Separated.       C. Forced out.     D. Tracked down.
    30. What did the disappearance of gray wolves bring about?
   A. Damage to local ecology.        
   B. A decline in the park’s income.
   C. Preservation of vegetation.       
   D. An increase in the variety of animals.
    31. What is the author’s attitude towards the Yellowstone wolf project?
   A. Doubtful.       B. Positive.       C. Disapproving.    D. Uncaring.
D
    The Intelligent Transport team at Newcastle University have turned an electric car into a mobile laboratory named “DriveLAB” in order to understand the challenges faced by older drivers and to discover where the key stress points are.
    Research shows that giving up driving is one of the key reasons for a fall in health and well-being among older people, leading to them becoming more isolated(隔绝) and inactive.
    Led by Professor Phil Blythe, the Newcastle team are developing in-vehicle technologies for older drivers which they hope could help them to continue driving into later life.
    These include custom-made navigation(导航) tools, night vision systems and intelligent speed adaptations. Phil Blythe explains: “For many older people, particularly those living alone or in the country, driving is important for preserving their independence, giving them the freedom to get out and about without having to rely on others.”
    “But we all have to accept that as we get older our reactions slow down and this often results in people avoiding any potentially challenging driving conditions and losing confidence in their driving skills. The result is that people stop driving before they really need to.”
Dr Amy Guo, the leading researcher on the older driver study, explains, “The DriveLAB is helping us to understand what the key stress points and difficulties are for older drivers and how we might use technology to address these problems.
    “For example, most of us would expect older drivers always go slower than everyone else but surprisingly, we found that in 30mph zones they struggled to keep at a constant speed and so were more likely to break the speed limit and be at risk of getting fined. We’re looking at the benefits of systems which control their speed as a way of preventing that.
 “We hope that our work will help with technological solutions(解决方案) to ensure that older drivers stay safer behind the wheel.”
32.What is the purpose of the Drivel AB?
  A.To explore new means of transport.         B.To design new types of cars.
  C.To find out older driver`s problems.         D.To teach people traffic rules.
33.Why is driving important for older people according to Phil Blythe?
  A.It keeps them independent.              B.It helps them save time.
  C.It builds up their strength.               D.It cures their mental illnesses.
34.What do researchers hope to do for older drivers?
  A.Improve their driving skills.          B. Develop driver-assist technologies.
  C.Provide tips on repairing their cars.    D.Organize regular physical checkups.
35.What is the best title for the text?
  A. A new Model Electric Car           B.A Solution to Traffic Problem
  C.Driving Service for elders           D.Keeping Older Drivers on the Road

Lots of people find it hard to get up in the morning and put the blame on the alarm clock. In fact, the key to easy morning wake-up lies in resetting your body clock   36     Here is how to make one.
●    37     In order to make a change, you need to decide why it's important. Do you want to get up in time to have breakfast with your family, get in some exercise, or just be better prepared for your day? Once you are clear about your reasons, tell your family or roommates about the change you want to make.
    • Rethink mornings. Now that you know why you want to wake up, consider re-arranging your morning activities. If you want time to have breakfast with your family, save some time the night before by setting out clothes, shoes, and bags.   38   That’s a quarter-hour more you could be sleeping if you bought a coffee maker with a timer.
    • Keep your sleep/wake schedule on weekends. If you’re tired out by Friday night, sleeping in on Saturday could sound wonderful. But compensating on the weekends actually feeds into your sleepiness the following week, a recent study found.   39   
    • Keep a record and evaluate it weekly. Keep track of your efforts and write down how you feel. After you’ve tried a new method for a week, take a look at your record.   40   
If not, take another look at other methods you could try.
A. Get a sleep specialist.
B. Find the right motivation.
C. A better plan for sleep can help.
D. And consider setting a second alarm.
E. If the steps you take are working, keep it up.
F. Stick to your set bedtime and wake-up time, no matter the day.
G. Reconsider the 15 minutes you spend in line at the café to get coffee.

There was a gardener who looked after his garden with great care .To water his flowers, he used two buckers .One was a shiny and new bucket. The other was a very old and dilapidated one.  Which had seen many years of service, but was now past its best.
Every morning, the gardener would fill up the two buckets. Then he would carry them along the path, one on each side, to the flowerbeds. The new bucket was very proud of itself. It could carry a full bucket of water without a single drop spilled (溢出). The old bucket felt very ashamed because of its holes: before it reached the flowerbeds, much water had leaked along the path.
Sometimes the new bucket would say,“ See how capable I am ! How good it is that the gardener has me to water the flowers every day ! I don't know why he still bothers with you. What a waste of space you are!”
And all that the old bucket could say was. “ I know I am not very useful, but I can only do my best .I am happy that the gardener still finds a little bit of use in me ,at least .”
One day, the gardener heard that kind or conversation .After watering the flowers as usual .he said ,”You both have done your work very well .Now I am going to carry you back .I want you to look carefully along the path.”
Then the two buckets did so.All along the path,they noticed,on the side where the new bucket was carried.there was just bare（光秃秃的）earth;one the other side where the old bucket was carried.there was a joyous row of wild flowers,leading all the way to the garden.
28 .What does the underlined word“dilapidated”probably mean?
A.Dirty   B.Dark   C.Worn-outD.Plain-looking.
29 .What was the old bucket ashamed of?
A.His past.  B.His aging.  C.His manner.  D.His leaking.
30 .The new bucket made conversations with the old one mainly to          
A. laugh at the old one      B. take pity on the old one
C.show off its beautiful looks  D. praise the gardener’s kindness
31 .Why was the old bucket still kept by the gardener?
A.Because it was used to keep a balance
B.Because it stayed in its best condition
C.Because it was taken as a treasure
D.Because it had its own function
                               D
Humans are naturally drawn to other life forms and the worlds outside of our own. We take delight in the existence of creatures and even whole societies beyond our everyday lives.
This sense of wonder is universal. Look at the efforts that scientists have made to find out whether life of some kind exists on Mars, and the popularity of fantasy(幻想) literature or movies like The Lord of the Rings. This sense of wonder draws us to each other, to the world around us, and to the world of make-believe. But have we gone so far in creating worlds of fantasy that we are missing the pleasure of other worlds that already exist all around us?
Human beings, as biologists have suggested, possess an inborn desire to connect with and understand other life forms. However, people, especially in big cities, often lead rather isolated lives. In a study of British schoolchildren, it was found that children by age eight were much more familiar with characters from television shows and video games than with common wildlife. Without modem technology, a small pond could be an amazing world filled with strange and beautiful plants, insects, birds, and animals. When we lack meaningful interaction(交互) with the world around us, and sometimes even with our families and friends, we seek to understand and communicate with things that exist only in our imaginations or on a computer screen。
The world of make-believe is not necessarily bad. But when the world of fantasy becomes the only outlet(出路) for our sense of wonder, then we are really missing something. We are missing a connection with the living world. Other wonderful worlds exist all around us. But even more interesting is that if we look closely enough, we can see that these worlds, in a broad sense, are really part of our own.
32．The popularity of the lord of the rings proves        
A．the close connection between man and the fantasy world
B．the wonderful achievements of fantasy literature
C．the fine taste of moviegoers around the world
D．the general existence of the sense of curiosity
33．What can we infer from the underlined sentence in Paragraph 3?
A．people are far less familiar with the world of fantasy
B．the world around us could serve as a source of wonder
C．the world of fantasy can be mirrored by a small and lively pond.
D．Modern technology prevents us from developing our sense of wonder
34．If our sense of wonder relies totally on the world of make-believe, we will        
A．fail to appreciate the joy in our lives
B．be confused by the world of make-believe
C．miss the chance to recognize the fantasy world
D．be trapped by other worlds existing all around us
35.  What is the main purpose of the passage?
A. To show us the hidden beauty in our world.
B. to warn us not to get lost in the fantasy world.
C. To argue against the misuse of the sense of wonder.
D. To discuss the influence of the world of make-believe.

____36    When a starving man gets a meal, he begins to think about an overcoat; when an executive gets a new sports car, visions of country clubs and pleasure beats dance into view.
The many wants of mankind might be regarded as making up several levels.     37    .
The first and most basic level of wants involves food. Once this want is satisfied, a second level of wants appears: clothing and some sort of shelter. By the end of World War II these wants were satisfied for a great majority of Americans.     38     It included such items as automobiles and new houses.
By 1957 or 1958 this third level of wants was fairly well satisfied. Then, in the late 1950s a fourth level of wants appeared: the “life-enriching” level. While the other levels involve physical satisfaction－the feeding, comfort, safety, and transportation of the human body－this level stresses mental needs for recognition, achievement and happiness. It includes a variety of goods and services, many of which could be called “luxury” items. Among them are vacation trips, the best medical care, and entertainment.     39      
On this level, a greater percentage of consumer spending goes to services, while on the first three levels more is spent on goods. Will consumers raise their sights to a fifth level of wants as their income increases, or will they continue to demand luxuries and personal services on the fourth level?
     A fifth level probably would involve wants that can be achieved best by community action. Consumers may be spending more on taxes to pay for government action against disease, ignorance, crime and prejudice.     40     In this way, we can enjoy more fully the good things on the first four levels.
A. Then a third level appeared.
B. Different people have different wants on each level.
C. There are several levels of wants in one’s life.
D. When there is money enough to satisfy one level of wants, another level appears
E. At this stage, we now may seek to ensure the health, safety, and leisure.
F. Also included here are fancy foods and the latest styles in clothing.
G. Human wants seem endless.

大庆实验中学2016年高考得分训练
英语（一）
说明：本试卷分第一卷（选择题）和第二卷（非选择题）两部分，满分120*1.25=150分，时间100分钟
第一卷
第一部分　阅读理解（共两节，满分40分） 
第一节（共15小题；每小题2分，满分30分） 
阅读下列短文，从每题所给的四个选项（A、B、C和D）中，选出最佳选项。
                                A
My daughter Kelly is a cautious person. She needs to warm up to situations, and is hesitant to try new things. When with close friends, she becomes a leader who laughs loudly and chants, “Girls rule, boys drool (流口水)” But when that comfort zone is not around her, she is shy and nervous.
This had been challenging for me at times. “Shy” is not a word that I think has ever been used to describe me. But this has been a year of “firsts” for my girl that has filled her with a new sense of confidence. This year she moved to lap lane in swimming where she was preparing for a swim team. This year she learned to ride a bike without training wheels. And this year she completed her first kids’ triathlon (三项全能).
On Saturday, with a thunderstorm coming soon and my son’s birthday party later in the day, we all went out in the dark of the morning for Kelly to participate in her first triathlon. We practiced transitions (过渡) from swim to bike to run with her, we got all the equipment she’d need, and we kept talking about the race. But as we waited the two hours for the older kids to finish before her turn, she held my leg a little harder and told me she loved me many times. She was nervous but trying to keep it together.
And then it was her turn. From the second she jumped into the water, my face lit up. My daughter transformed into the most confident human being I had ever seen. She dominated (主宰) that swim, won that bike ride and ran to the finish with the biggest smile on her face.
I can honestly say that I never felt so proud of someone in my entire life. It wasn’t because she did a sport or anything like that. It was because she was afraid of something and conquered (克服) that fear with confidence and a fire I hadn’t seen before.
All day I would find myself just looking over at her and smiling. She might be wearing the finalist medal but I felt like I won that day. I won the chance to see my girl shine.
Shine on, sweet baby.
1. Kelly is nervous when ______.
A. situations are new to her					B. boys are around her
C. she changes into a leader					D. she is away from her mom
2. We can know from the Paragraph 3 ______ .
A. the race began in the early morning
B. the whole family gave Kelly support
C. Kelly was eager for her turn in the race
D. Kelly prepared for her brother’s birthday party
3. Seeing Kelly’s performance in the race, the author felt ______.
A. excited and proud						B. anxious and uneasy
C. curious and concerned					D. worried and hesitant
4. The author “felt like I won that day ” because Kelly ______.
A. expressed love to her						B. won the gold medal
C. took part in the sport						D. overcame the fear
B
We’ve all had that moment when we are in the middle of sorting old clothes, or walking down the street and passing a restaurant, or someone hugs you and their pleasant smell go slightly and you’re instantly transported to a past memory or you feel an emotional response to that smell.
For me, the smell of bubble bath will always make me think of long soaps in the big claw-footed bath and my grandma’s house in the UK! If this sounds like you too, there is a reason for it. Psychologist Sabina Read explains, “Fragrance is commonly linked to our mood and behavior via learned emotional responses associated with smells and past experiences. If we smell roses while visiting a sick loved one in hospital, the smell may arouse sadness or grief (哀伤); however if we first smell roses after giving birth, we will most likely associate that smell with feelings of joy and love. Therefore fragrance plays a powerful role in mood and emotion across our life.”
And it’s this understanding which Imperial Leather has used in creating their new fragrance range. The brand undertook a survey of 2,200 Australians on fragrances and smells --- and some of the results might surprise you.
* A huge 97 percent of people feel more confident just by wearing a fragrance.
* Women feel most attractive wearing a floral (花香的) scent.
* Floral fragrances are the most attractive scent with men voting it as their favorite scent for a partner.
* Over half the nation, 51 percent, have used the same fragrance for five years or more.
5. When we are sorting old clothes, their pleasant smell may ______.
A. be always full of our memory
B. drive us to change for new ones
C. have a positive effect on our emotion
D. remind us a certain past memory or feelings on it
    6. By giving examples, the writer makes us learn that ______.
A. roses are always connected with joy and love
B. fragrance plays an important role in our mood and emotion
C. the big claw-footed bath calls up the memory of his grandma’s house
D. Imperial Leather conducted a survey to create their new fragrance range
7. What would be the best title for the passage?
A. The Truth Behind Fragrances and Feelings
B. Smell Associated with Emotion
C. A Survey by Imperial Leather
D. My Past Memory of Smell
    8. What can you do if you want to make yourself attractive?
    A. Wear some old clothes full of memories.
    B. Take a bubble bath every day.
    C. Wear some kind of fragrance.
    D. Avoid visiting people in hospital.
C
Teenagers have fewer friends than 20 years ago, research has shown --- despite the increasing popularity of social media.
A study carried out by experts at The University of Queensland in Australia, found teens felt less lonely than two decades ago --- but that they have poorer social networks.
A survey of more than 285,000 US high school students carried out between 1991 and 2012 found young people had fewer friends with whom to interact, but less desire for more friends.
The Globe and Mail quotes the findings of the research, printed in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, which suggests economic changes may have helped increased individuality (个体意识) among young people.
The authors behind the study wrote, “Greater economic opportunities offer individuals more freedom to manage their own money, decide whom to date and decide whom to marry, reducing the influence of relatives and giving people more freedom, which may increase individualism.”
“Economic changes lead to increased individuality, which could lead to decreasing interest in friends, increasing self-reliance, increasing self-esteem (自尊) and decreasing loneliness.”
Lead researcher, Dr. David Clark said further research on cultures outside the US would help determine if modernization is the root cause of the observed results.
He said, “If other cultures show the same pattern of reduced loneliness in the face of poorer social networks, this would support the idea that modernization is responsible.”
The findings have shown that the growing use of social networking sites has had a negative effect on the quality of people’s friendships.
A study from 2006 by sociologists at Duke University also showed that on average most adults only have two people they can talk to about the most important subjects in their lives while one quarter had no close friends at all.
9. Compared with 20 years ago, what do we know about teenagers today?
A. They feel more lonely.					B. They have fewer friends.
C. They have wider social networks.			D. They are more eager to make friends.
10. What may economic changes make teens do today?
A. Desire more friends.						B. Feel more lonely.
C. Be more independent.						D. Make money more easily.
11. In Dr. David Clark’s view, ______.
A. some adults have no close friends at all
B. teens should get away from social networks
C. all cultures show teens today feel less lonely
D. modernization may cause teens’ reduced loneliness
                                          D
I cherish being around people who are totally comfortable with who they are. There always seems to be an aura (光环) of love and acceptance that follows these people around. I think it is because they have figured out one of the biggest secrets to life: the chance of being loved and accepted grows so much when we can truly say we couldn’t be more comfortable with ourselves.
People like being round those who are comfortable with themselves because they are less threatening. We all feel the need to protect ourselves from threats aimed at our insecurities. Insecurities are like open wounds and it hurts when people poke (捅；戳) at them. It can be exhausting to hang around people who constantly poke at us just to get some kind of external (外界的) recognition through making everyone else feel smaller.
My favorite thing about people who are comfortable with themselves is that they need no external recognition. They have discovered their worth is, by nature, something that cannot be taken away or added to according to what other people think. Ironically (讽刺地) enough, this ends up providing comfortable people with more external recognition than those who feel they need it most. Because comfortable people’s worth comes from within, they see no point in tearing others down. To them, the only sensible way to speak about another is to be positive.
I guess when you realize your worth comes from within, you might as well build others up rather than tear them down, since their size is of no threat to your sense of self-worth. Plus, it is a lot more fun to speak love to others and watch their eyes light up than it is to hurt someone’s feelings for a cheap laugh, anyway. When we become comfortable with ourselves through fully accepting who we are, we can silence the noise our insecurities make in public situations and enjoy the wonderful reality before us.
The result is a world with fewer insecurities. To me, that sounds like a better world.
12. Which of the following sayings best express the main idea of the passage?
A. Actions speak louder than words.
B. No pains, no gains.
C. Luck favors those who are comfortable with who they are.
D. Don’t pretend to know what you don’t know.
13. What does the underlined word “them” in Paragraph 2 probably mean?
A. Insecurities.								B. Open wounds.
C. People who are comfortable with themselves.		D. Threats.
14. The reasons why the author loves with people who are comfortable with themselves are the following except that ______.
A. there will be an aura of love and acceptance that follows these people around
B. they are less threatening
C. they always have a positive attitude toward others
D. the author needs external recognition
15. What is the purpose of writing this passage?
A. To give a description of people who are comfortable with themselves.
B. To ask people to make friends with people who are comfortable with themselves.
C. To offer some advice on how to be persons who are comfortable with themselves.
D. To appeal to people to be comfortable with themselves so that we can live in a better world.

Ways to Improve Your Luck
Some people have all the luck! Or does it just seem that way? Why did your co-worker get that big promotion while you were overlooked? Why do some of us seem to experience these lucky things more than others and how can you improve your luck? ___16___
What You Tell Yourself Matters!
Do you know that people who are lucky tell themselves they’re lucky? Has your own self-talk been filled with less-than-lucky talk?

I know things will turn around.” or “Things have a way of working out for me.”
Expect and Acknowledge Your Good Luck.
___18___ Research suggests keeping a “good luck journal” helps people become even luckier. Did someone bring you coffee at work today? Did you find a random quarter on the street? Did your husband or wife do something nice for you today? Did your child get a good grade at school? Write them down! ___19___ Begin to notice all the good that comes to you.
Do Something New and Different.
Make contact with people. Take risks. People who try new things are much more open to luck and good fortune than those who don’t. This doesn’t mean you have to quit your job or take up skydiving! It could be as simple as starting a conversation with a stranger, taking a class in an unfamiliar subject, learning some words and phrases in a foreign language, or trying a new ethnic restaurant. ___20___ And this greater openness can help promote chance opportunities in their lives.

There was a gardener who looked after his garden with great care .To water his flowers, he used two buckers .One was a shiny and new bucket. The other was a very old and dilapidated one.  Which had seen many years of service, but was now past its best.
Every morning, the gardener would fill up the two buckets. Then he would carry them along the path, one on each side, to the flowerbeds. The new bucket was very proud of itself. It could carry a full bucket of water without a single drop spilled (溢出). The old bucket felt very ashamed because of its holes: before it reached the flowerbeds, much water had leaked along the path.
Sometimes the new bucket would say,“ See how capable I am ! How good it is that the gardener has me to water the flowers every day ! I don't know why he still bothers with you. What a waste of space you are!”
And all that the old bucket could say was. “ I know I am not very useful, but I can only do my best .I am happy that the gardener still finds a little bit of use in me ,at least .”
One day, the gardener heard that kind or conversation .After watering the flowers as usual .he said ,”You both have done your work very well .Now I am going to carry you back .I want you to look carefully along the path.”
Then the two buckets did so.All along the path,they noticed,on the side where the new bucket was carried.there was just bare（光秃秃的）earth;one the other side where the old bucket was carried.there was a joyous row of wild flowers,leading all the way to the garden.
28 .What does the underlined word“dilapidated”probably mean?
A.Dirty   B.Dark   C.Worn-outD.Plain-looking.
29 .What was the old bucket ashamed of?
A.His past.  B.His aging.  C.His manner.  D.His leaking.
30 .The new bucket made conversations with the old one mainly to          
A. laugh at the old one      B. take pity on the old one
C.show off its beautiful looks  D. praise the gardener’s kindness
31 .Why was the old bucket still kept by the gardener?
A.Because it was used to keep a balance
B.Because it stayed in its best condition
C.Because it was taken as a treasure
D.Because it had its own function
                               D
Humans are naturally drawn to other life forms and the worlds outside of our own. We take delight in the existence of creatures and even whole societies beyond our everyday lives.
This sense of wonder is universal. Look at the efforts that scientists have made to find out whether life of some kind exists on Mars, and the popularity of fantasy(幻想) literature or movies like The Lord of the Rings. This sense of wonder draws us to each other, to the world around us, and to the world of make-believe. But have we gone so far in creating worlds of fantasy that we are missing the pleasure of other worlds that already exist all around us?
Human beings, as biologists have suggested, possess an inborn desire to connect with and understand other life forms. However, people, especially in big cities, often lead rather isolated lives. In a study of British schoolchildren, it was found that children by age eight were much more familiar with characters from television shows and video games than with common wildlife. Without modem technology, a small pond could be an amazing world filled with strange and beautiful plants, insects, birds, and animals. When we lack meaningful interaction(交互) with the world around us, and sometimes even with our families and friends, we seek to understand and communicate with things that exist only in our imaginations or on a computer screen。
The world of make-believe is not necessarily bad. But when the world of fantasy becomes the only outlet(出路) for our sense of wonder, then we are really missing something. We are missing a connection with the living world. Other wonderful worlds exist all around us. But even more interesting is that if we look closely enough, we can see that these worlds, in a broad sense, are really part of our own.
32．The popularity of the lord of the rings proves        
A．the close connection between man and the fantasy world
B．the wonderful achievements of fantasy literature
C．the fine taste of moviegoers around the world
D．the general existence of the sense of curiosity
33．What can we infer from the underlined sentence in Paragraph 3?
A．people are far less familiar with the world of fantasy
B．the world around us could serve as a source of wonder
C．the world of fantasy can be mirrored by a small and lively pond.
D．Modern technology prevents us from developing our sense of wonder
34．If our sense of wonder relies totally on the world of make-believe, we will        
A．fail to appreciate the joy in our lives
B．be confused by the world of make-believe
C．miss the chance to recognize the fantasy world
D．be trapped by other worlds existing all around us
35.  What is the main purpose of the passage?
A. To show us the hidden beauty in our world.
B. to warn us not to get lost in the fantasy world.
C. To argue against the misuse of the sense of wonder.
D. To discuss the influence of the world of make-believe.

____36    When a starving man gets a meal, he begins to think about an overcoat; when an executive gets a new sports car, visions of country clubs and pleasure beats dance into view.
The many wants of mankind might be regarded as making up several levels.     37    .
The first and most basic level of wants involves food. Once this want is satisfied, a second level of wants appears: clothing and some sort of shelter. By the end of World War II these wants were satisfied for a great majority of Americans.     38     It included such items as automobiles and new houses.
By 1957 or 1958 this third level of wants was fairly well satisfied. Then, in the late 1950s a fourth level of wants appeared: the “life-enriching” level. While the other levels involve physical satisfaction－the feeding, comfort, safety, and transportation of the human body－this level stresses mental needs for recognition, achievement and happiness. It includes a variety of goods and services, many of which could be called “luxury” items. Among them are vacation trips, the best medical care, and entertainment.     39      
On this level, a greater percentage of consumer spending goes to services, while on the first three levels more is spent on goods. Will consumers raise their sights to a fifth level of wants as their income increases, or will they continue to demand luxuries and personal services on the fourth level?
     A fifth level probably would involve wants that can be achieved best by community action. Consumers may be spending more on taxes to pay for government action against disease, ignorance, crime and prejudice.     40     In this way, we can enjoy more fully the good things on the first four levels.
A. Then a third level appeared.
B. Different people have different wants on each level.
C. There are several levels of wants in one’s life.
D. When there is money enough to satisfy one level of wants, another level appears
E. At this stage, we now may seek to ensure the health, safety, and leisure.
F. Also included here are fancy foods and the latest styles in clothing.
G. Human wants seem endless.

    Campbell Remess taught himself how to sew when he was only 9 years old. It all started three years ago, when Campbell asked his parents if they could buy Christmas presents for kids in hospital. They were touched by his kindness, but told him that buying so many toys would be too costly. He is one of nine children, and buying presents for all of them was already a pretty expensive affair for the parents.
    Campbell didn’t let a simple “no” discourage him from bringing a bit of joy to kids going through tough times, so he decided to make the presents himself. It took the 9-year-old boy five hours to create his first stuffed（填充的）toy. However after three years of practice, he is now able to put one together in just an hour.
    “I was blown away by the first bear,” his mother said. “Overly impressed but not surprised at his determination to teach himself.” The successful experiment only inspired Campbell Remess to become better at sewing, and challenged himself to create one stuffed toy per day and dot, ate them to sick children struggling in the hospital. Project 365 by Campbell was born. Over the last three years, Campbell Remess has created over 800 stuffed toys for sick children.
    Campbell sends his toys to children all over the world, and still visits the Royal Hobart Hospital in his home city of Hobart, Tasmania, to personally gift toy animals to sick kids there and loves to see the reaction on their faces. “They smile and some hug me. It makes their whole day better,” he says.
    “Campbell is just wired really differently. He looks at sadness and tries to turn it upside down,” his mother says. “He’s not a quitter—I only see bigger and brighter things for him.”
25. Why did Campbell’s parents refuse his request?
    A. They were on a tight budget.          B. They wished him to depend on himself.
    C. They thought that was ridiculous.
    D. They hoped he could share his things with others.
26. What desire drove Campbell to make toys for sick children?

Kindergarten—which means “garden for children” in German—is not kindergarten any more. It’s yesterday’s first grade, or even second.
    A 2014 study compared kindergarten teachers’ expectations for their students in 1998 to today. The differences were striking. In 1998, 31 percent of teachers thought that kindergarten students should be able to read by the end of the year. By 2014, that figure is now about 80 percent. More than a third kindergarten teachers now think that kids should enter school already knowing the alphabet and how to hold a pencil.
    Besides, the researchers found huge decreases in the amount of self-directed, creative play time—dress up, art, sand and water play—and increases in the amount of time students were involved in teacher-directed, whole-class instruction.
    Unfortunately, kindergarten today ignores a basic fact of young children’s development that is well-known by early childhood educators: normal development in young children occurs at very different rates and in very different ways. For example, the average age that a baby                                                                                                                    starts to walk is 12 months, but some kids start walking at eight or nine months and others at 15, or even 16, months.
    Similarly, the average age that a child learns to be an independent reader is about six and a half. Some learn to read at four, and others at seven, and both extremes are developmentally normal. In the fourth grade, kids who learned to read at four are typically not any better at reading than those who started at seven. Countries like Finland and Sweden do not even start formal academic schooling until age seven.
    We need to respect children’s personal developmental timelines. The idea that “earlier is better” for reading instruction is simply not supported by research evidence. Children’s long-term achievement and self-identities as readers and students can be damaged when they are introduced to reading too early.
28. What can we infer from the text?
    A. Kindergarten has been replaced by first or even second grade.
    B. Children should know the alphabet before entering kindergarten.
    C. Kindergarten students’ intelligence has been largely improved.
    D. Kindergarten teachers have higher expectations for students now.
29. What will probably happen to children who learn to read at 7 ?
    A. They will perform best among their classmates.
    B. They will have difficulty becoming an independent reader.
    C. They will fall behind those who learn to read earlier forever.
    D. They will catch up with those who learn to read earlier.
30. What should kindergarten teachers do according to the text?
    A. Increase the time in whole-class instruction.
    B. Encourage children to learn at their own pace.
    C. Pay more attention to children’s academic level.
    D. Raise children’s competitive spirit at an early age.
31. How does the author feel about the present education in kindergarten?
    A. Ashamed.      B. Cautious.         C. Concerned.       D. Satisfied.

Since 2013, Torobo, a robotic arm designed to test the limits of artificial intelligence, has had one ambition—to be admitted to the University of Tokyo.  However, it has repeatedly failed. This year was no exception.
    In early November Torobo took an exam to prepare for an all-important standardized test. While Torobo’s overall score of 525 out of 950 was 14 points higher than in 2015, its standard score of 57.1% was slightly lower, because human students did better in the 2016 test.
    Though the score, which is higher than the national average, is enough to get the robot admitted to many other famous Japanese universities, it falls short of the minimum required for the University of Tokyo.
    A closer analysis of the results showed that Torobo’s newly programmed ability to solve complex physics problems helped increase its year-over-year physics score from 46.5% to 59%. The robot also dug deep into its database of information from textbooks and websites to obtain an impressive 66.3% in world history. The average 60% scores acquired in the two math sections, were not too shabby either.
    But, while Torobo is able to handle knowledge-based questions and ones involving complex mathematical calculations, it has a hard time thinking independently. As a result, the robot is unable to comprehend multiple sentences and phrases to arrive at the logical conclusions required in the English language tests. This weakness was reflected in the weak oral and writing scores, which came in at 36.2% and 50.5%, respectively.
    Fortunately, after four grueling years, the robot’s creators have decided to free Torobo from its annual test-taking suffering. The research team will instead focus on improving the robot’s ability to pick out specific answers from massive sets of data—a skill that led to its excellent history scores. They believe the expertise（专门技术）will help Torobo succeed as an industrial robot.
32. What is the disadvantage of Torobo?
A. It doesn’t own language skills.        
B. It couldn’t sit through the exams.
    C. It has much difficulty searching for facts.
    D. It has weak independent thinking ability.
33. What does the underlined word “grueling” in the last paragraph probably mean?
    A. happy         B. successful        C. tiring            D. independent
34. What did the exam results show?
    A. Torobo did well in the history exam.
    B. Torobo was admitted to a university.
    C. Torobo’s score didn’t reach the national average.
    D. Torobo’s programmed ability improved its math score.
35. What is the text mainly about?
    A. Subjects a robot is good at.           B. A robot’s performances in exams.
    C. A robot’s ways to deal with exams.     D. Majors that are suitable for a robot.

How to Stay Positive
    There are two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle（奇迹）. The other is as though everything is a miracle. If you choose to be positive, these ideas can be helpful.
◆  36  
    Who in your life seems filled with positivity? Who inspires and challenges you to up your game? Consciously build a network of people who motivate you to be your best, then spend your time with them. Be that source of light for others, too.
◆ Feed yourself with positivity.
      37   Similarly, how you fuel yourself will determine your experience as well. Read inspiring books. Watch encouraging movies. Follow positive people on social media. You can also create a physical environment of positivity.
◆Focus on what you can control.
    So much is out of our hands, isn’t it?   38   Determine what you can control and put your energy there.  For example,  you can control your responses, actions, words, and thoughts; you can be the change you wish to see in the world. You have more power than you realize.   39  
◆Watch your vocabulary.
Mother Teresa declined participation in an anti-war meet. When asked why, she replied that she did not want to give any attention to war, but she’d gladly participate in a pro-peace meet.   __40   They can help you mend broken hearts and reach amazing goals.
    Continue to feed that positive world—like Einstein said, living as though everything is a miracle—and watch life change accordingly.
A. Pay attention to your words.
B. Surround yourself with positive people.
C. Seek advice from positive and active people.
D. And when you keep your focus there, that power expands.
E. Focusing on that, however, can leave you feeling helpless.
F. If you focus on that change, then everything will change for the better.
G. Putting poor quality gas in your car will not help it run at best performance.

All of a sudden, a boy ran into him, making some food dropping on his trousers, what I thought would make him annoyed with the boy. Instead, he laughs it off when the mother made the apology to him. “Never mind!” he said polite. Seeing this, I touched and appreciated the kindness he brought to the world.

Stanley Yelnats was given a choice. The judge said, “You may go to prison, or you may go to Camp Green Lake.” Stanley was from a poor family. He had never been to camp before. So, Stanley Yelnats seems set to serve an easy sentence, which is only fair because he is as innocent as you or me. But Stanley is not going where he thinks he is.
Camp Green Lake is like no other camp anywhere. It is a place that has no lake and nothing green. Nor is it a camp, at least not the kind of camp kids look forward to in the summertime. It is only a desert wasteland, dotted with countless holes dug by the boys who live at the camp.
The trouble started when Stanley was accused of stealing a pair of shoes donated by basketball great Clyde “Sweetfeet” Livingston to a celebrity auction (名流拍卖会). In court, the judge doesn’t believe Stanley’s explanation that the shoes fell from the sky onto his head. And yet, that’s exactly what happened. Strangely, though, Stanley doesn’t blame the 
judge for falsely convicting (宣告有罪  ) him. Instead, he blames the whole thing on his 
“no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather.” Thanks to this distant relative, the Yelnats family had been cursed (诅咒) for generations. For Stanley, his current troubles are just a natural part of being a Yelnats.
At Camp Green Lake, the warden (看守) makes the boys “build character” by spending all day, every day, digging holes: five feet wide and five feet deep. It doesn’t take long for Stanley to realize there’s more than character improvement going on at Camp Green Lake. The boys are digging holes because the warden is searching for something, and before long Stanley begins his own search — for the truth. Fate is to find a solution to it all — the family curse, the mystery of the holes. The great wheel of justice has ground slowly for generations, but now it is about to reveal its verdict (裁决).

24. Stanley Yelnats went to Camp Green Lake to _____.
A. serve his sentence 						B. make a choice
C. enjoy the summertime					D. show his innocence
25. We can learn from the passage that Stanley _____.
A. donated the shoes to an auction			B. blamed the judge for the sentence
C. stole the shoes for his relative			D. got the shoes by accident
26. In fact, the warden makes the boys dig holes to _____.
A. break the family curse 	 				B. look for something
C. kill the time							D. build character
27. What does the underlined sentence in Paragraph Three mean?
A. Everyone believes Stanley is born in a criminal family. 
B. Actually his relative’s stealing the shoes causes Stanley’s trouble. 
C. Stanley believes he deserves his troubles because of his stealing. 
D. Stanley thinks he is in trouble for being a member of his family. 
C
Cooking programs and classes for children seem to positively influence children’s food preferences and behaviors, according to a recent review. Although the review didn’t look at long-term effects of such programs, the findings suggest that such programs might help children develop long-lasting healthy habits.
This research comes at a time when childhood obesity（肥胖）rates have been rising rapidly. More than one-third of adolescents in the United States were obese in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This trend has been caused, at least in part, by a significant decrease in the amount of meals that people consume at home since the 1980s, according to background information in the study. 
Cooking education programs, such as Food Explorers, teach children about new healthy foods and how to prepare them. They also stress the importance of eating five fruits and vegetables every day. A volunteer parent explains a new food to the group, and the kids make something based on the lesson, such as fruit or vegetable salad. Depending on the program, kids may be sent home with information about healthy foods to bring to their parents, the review explained.
The study team reviewed eight other researches that tested different types of cooking education programs. Children in these classes were between 5 and 12 years old, according to the review. The goal of the study team was to learn more about developing an efficient program to encourage healthy food choices that last a lifetime. The study found that it is particularly important to expose kids to healthy foods on a number of occasions. This makes them feel comfortable with the new foods, which helps them build healthy habits.
The study stressed the importance of getting parents involved in their children’s eating habits. Parents who are unable to enroll their kids in a cooking class can achieve similar benefits by having their kids help them while they prepare meals at home. Children are more comfortable at home, which makes them more receptive to new foods because they will make the connection to a positive experience.

28. What can we infer from the second paragraph?
A. Childhood obesity rates have been rising rapidly since 2016
B. Food consumption has decreased significantly since the 1980s.
C. Eating out frequently may cause obesity in some sense.
D. Childhood obesity is totally caused by eating habits.
29. In cooking education programs, ________.
A. children may learn information unfamiliar to their parents
B. children focus more on cooking skills than on information about healthy foods
C. children learn how to prepare foods from their parents
D. children will learn how to cook in company with their parents
30. Which of the following is true according to the study? 
A. Children who participate in cooking programs are more likely to become obese.
B. Children should eat fruits and vegetables all the time. 
C. Parents should let their kids cook independently at home.
D. A greater willingness to try new foods helps building healthy habits.
31. Which of the following categories does this passage belong to?
A. Parent-child Relationship				B. Public Health Research
C. Education Systems	   					D. Science and Technology 

D
Loneliness is like a disease, and what’s worse, it’s infectious. It can spread from one person to another, according to the recent research that stresses the power of one person’s emotions to affect even people they don’t know.
The new analysis, involving 4,793 people who were interviewed every two years between 2006 and 2016, showed that a friend of a lonely person was 52% more likely to develop feelings of loneliness by the time of the next interview. A friend of that person was 25% more likely, and a friend of a friend of a friend was 15% more likely.
“Loneliness is not just the property of an individual. It can be transmitted across people—even people you don’t have direct contact with.” said John T. Cacioppo, a psychologist of University of Chicago who led the study published in the December issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.
Many factors can lead to loneliness, such as depression, sleep problems and generally poorer physical health. Identifying some of the causes could help reduce the emotion and improve health, experts said.
Although the study did not examine how loneliness spreads, Cacioppo said another research has provided clues. “Let’s say for whatever reason you get lonely. You then interact with other people in a more negative fashion. That puts them in a negative mood and makes them more likely to interact with other people in a negative fashion and they minimize their social ties and become lonely.” Cacioppo said.
According to Cacioppo, loneliness spread more easily among women than men, perhaps because women were more likely to express emotions.
Lonely people become less and less trusting others. This makes it more and more difficult for them to make friends—and more likely that society will reject them. Therefore, it is important to recognize and deal with loneliness. Cacioppo emphasizes people who have been pushed to the edges of society should receive help to repair their social networks.

With time going on, dogs have developed a special relationship with people. Recently, however, some dogs have taken a different role in people’s lives—therapy dogs.
       36    Some therapy dogs visit patients in hospitals or nursing homes, while others visit children in schools and libraries. They are there to help children become better readers.
Reading programs that use therapy dogs have been in existence for more than ten years. All therapy dogs of this program are registered with an organization that tests the dogs to make sure they have the right personality for the job.
       37    Both the dogs and the handlers are volunteers with the reading program.
At the start of a reading therapy session, a child and a dog are introduced. The pair is allowed to settle down in a quiet corner together.    38    An adult handler stays nearby but generally lets the dog perform its job without interfering(干涉). Sometimes, a handler may ask a question that encourages the child to work with the dog to help the child feel more comfortable. 
Not every child will be able to be part of a reading therapy program that uses dogs. A few children might be allergic to dogs or afraid of them; some children might have cultural traditions that prevent them from touching a dog.    39   
Reading therapy programs inspire learning and change for human beings.The readers benefit a lot, gaining confidence and learning that reading aloud can be a relaxing experience.
   40    They spend time with human friends. For dogs that love human companionship and a quiet place to rest, being part of a reading therapy program can be a great way to spend a few hours being with humans each day. 

  A. As the child reads, the dog usually lies quietly and listens.  
  B. A dog’s handler also takes a class and must pass a test to work in the therapy program.
  C. When reading to an animal, some children may become relaxed. 
  D. A therapy dog is more of a companion and is trained to help people in different ways.
  E.       But therapy animals also serve in many other areas.
  F.          In these circumstances, other animals are available, such as cats and parrots.
  G.     But how do the therapy dogs benefit from it?

Now satellites are helping to forecast（预报）the weather. They are in space, and they can reach any part of the world. The satellites take pictures of the atmosphere（大气）, because this is where the weather forms（形成）. They send these pictures to the weather stations. So meteorologists（气象学家）can see the weather of any part of the world. From the pictures, the scientists can often say how the weather will change.
Today, nearly five hundred weather stations in sixty countries receive satellite pictures. When they receive new pictures, the meteorologists compare（比较）them with earlier ones. Perhaps they may find that the clouds have changed during the last few hours. This may mean that the weather on the ground may soon change, too. In their next weather forecast, the meteorologists can say this.
So the weather satellites are a great help to the meteorologists. Before satellites were invented, the scientists could forecast the weather for about 24 or 48 hours. Now they can make good forecasts for three or five days. Soon, perhaps, they may be able to forecast the weather for a week or more ahead（提前）.

第一节(共15小题；每小题2分，满分30分)
阅读下列短文，从每题所给的四个选项(A、B、C和D)中，选出最佳选项。
A
Americans celebrate Memorial Day on the last Monday in May.It's not just about a day off school and the beginning of summer.This holiday goes all the way back to the Civil War and is celebrated by millions of people，especially America's veterans(退伍军人)．Memorial Day is a day to remember all those who died while serving their country.
The first Memorial Day was observed on May 30，1866 in Columbus，Georgia by women's groups who decorated the graves of soldiers with flowers.In 1868，General John Logan (a member of the Senate[参议院] at the time)，officially made Memorial Day a holiday to honor soldiers who had died in the Civil War.After World War I，the holiday didn't just honor those who died fighting in the Civil War but honored all Americans who died fighting in any war.Although the majority of the country celebrates Memorial Day on the last Monday in May，some southern states celebrate it on different days.
Since the late 1950s，the 1，200 soldiers of the 3rd US Infantry(步兵团) put small American flags on every grave (there are about 260，000 of them) at Arlington National Cemetery on the Thursday before Memorial Day.They then patrol(巡逻) the graveyard 24 hours a day during the weekend to make sure that every flag remains standing.On the Saturday before Memorial Day，the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts place a candle at each grave (there are about 15，300 of them) at the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park on Marye's Heights.They've been doing this since 1998.

You may be familiar with some of ancient Chinese musical instruments called Erhu or Guzheng，but you may be not familiar with some other ancient Chinese music instruments，such as the Hujia.These instruments are gradually dying out because of a lack of attention and preservation for them.But now，a young man in Northeast China's Shenyang City is hoping to change that.
Liu Da was born in Shenyang City，Liaoning Province，China and graduated from Tchaikovsky Music University in Ukraine two years ago，where he majored in piano.But rather than a pianist，Liu is now more like a carpenter for most of the day.And it's all for one thing：to recreate the musical instruments of ancient China.
“In Ukraine，during major festivals，the artists from around the world would dress up in their own traditional clothes and use their own musical instruments to play.I had an opportunity to see a lot of music instruments in these festivals.So I was inspired to present our culture，our music as well，from where I'm from，” Liu said.
Liu Da started to recreate ancient Chinese music instruments after he graduated from university.It usually takes him between six to eight months to make one ancient instrument.Liu Da has even learned the Manchu and Mongolian language，so he could consult historic files to make accurate designs.
During the last two years，he has recreated 23 different kinds of musical instruments from ancient China，some dating back over thousands of years.“This musical instrument is called a Hujia，a reed ripe(牧笛)．It dates back to 3，000 B．C. It's very old and it has a very interesting history，” Liu Da said.
Liu Da's next plan is to form a band with these 23 instruments to get an authentic flavor for ancient music.
5．Why are some ancient Chinese musical instruments dying out?
	A．They have lost their value in the modern society.
	B．People in China are not able to play them.
	C．People pay no attention to preservation for them.
	D．People in China don't know how to recreate them.
	6．What inspired Liu Da to recreate ancient Chinese musical instruments?
	A．No artists were invited to play in major festivals in Ukraine.
	B．Musicians played their own musical instruments in festivals.
	C．Artists from other countries knew little about Chinese culture and music.
	D．Chinese modern musical instruments were not popular with artists.
	7．It can be known from the passage that ________．
	A．Liu Da began making musical instruments when he was in the university
	B．Ancient Chinese musical instruments are easy to recreate for Liu Da
	C．Liu Da has recreated 23 different kinds of musical instruments from the world
	D．Liu Da has made great efforts to recreate ancient Chinese musical instruments
	8．What does Liu Da plan to do in the near future?

Do you think that you lack confidence in your daily life? Do you want to be more confident? The following tips will help you build your confidence.
Look At Yourself—Really look at yourself.Stand in front of your mirror and take a good look.This is really hard for a lot of kids to do，but try—it's important.That's your face that you're looking at and your face is going to be with you for a long time，so it would be really helpful if you would stop worrying so much about it and start liking it.Learning to look at yourself in the mirror and accepting all the good and not so good things about your face is an important step in feeling more comfortable with you and then，with everyone else.
Practice—It needs practice to make your face look perfect.But，if you look at other people's faces，you will see that no one looks perfect.You may think your favorite singer or actor looks perfect，but everyone's idea of perfection is different.Your job is to start seeing the beautiful things about you.It needs practice.You might notice that the expression on your face makes a big difference in how you look.
Dress for Comfort—It's important that clothes make you feel physically and emotionally comfortable.Clothes say a great deal about the person who's wearing them.Kids who want to get along well with others should wear clothes that are similar to what their classmates are wearing.Kids who wear very different clothes can't be welcomed by other kids.
Hygiene(卫生)—Now that you've paid attention to your face and your clothes，let's work on cleaning.The simple fact is that if a kid smells bad and has dirty teeth，other kids and grown－ups won't want to come too close.

Scientists pinpointed areas of the world where Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) mammals and amphibians(两栖动物) occur.Regions containing the highest concentrations of these species are highlighted as global conservation priorities.
The map reveals that high priority conservation areas for mammals and amphibians are different，reflecting the varied evolutionary histories and threats facing the two groups.For mammals，management efforts are best focused in Southeast Asia，southern Africa and Madagascar.For amphibians，Central and southern America are highlighted as priorities.
Professor Jonathan Baillie says: “The results of the mapping exercise are alarming.Currently only five percent of the areas we've identified as priorities for EDGE mammals and 15 percent of the EDGE amphibian areas are protected.These areas highlighted should all be global conservation priorities because they contain species that are not only highly threatened but also unique in the way they look，live and behave.These new maps will inform the development of larger－scale work to help secure the future of some of the most remarkable species on Earth.” 
Madagascar's black－and－white ruffed lemur(狐猴) is the largest lemur in the world and is threatened by hunting and the loss of its forest habitat to logging，mining and cutting and burning for agriculture.The Sunda pangolin(穿山甲)，occurs in Southeast Asia and is threatened by illegal hunting for its meat，as well as its scales which are thought to have high medicinal value.Other mammal species occurring in priority areas include the black rhino and western lowland gorilla.
Amphibians are facing a terrifying rate of extinction making them the most threatened animals in the world.The Mexican salamander(火蜥蜴)is critically endangered due to urbanization(城市化)，polluted waters，and the introduction of non－native fish which eat the axolotl's young.With the aid of the global map of EDGE amphibians，it will now be possible to concentrate efforts in countries such as，Mexico，Costa Rica and Guatemala where the most distinct and threatened species are found.
Professor Jonathan Baillie says：“This is the first global map to take into account species' uniqueness as well as threat.Now that we've identified EDGE priority areas for mammals and amphibians we can more effectively continue to ensure their protection.”
13．Which of the following can be the best title for the passage?
	A．Most mammals and amphibians in the world become extinct
	B．Conservation areas should be set up in more and more areas
	C．World's most extraordinary species mapped for the first time
	D．The most rare and threatened animals in the world were identified
	14．The method the writer uses to develop Paragraphs 4 and 5 is ________．
	A．offering analyses
	B．giving examples
	C．providing explanations
	D．making comparisons
	15．It can be known from the passage that ________．
	A．conservation areas for mammals and amphibians are almost the same
	B．human activities are the largest threat to mammals and amphibians
	C．the global map of EDGE amphibians does no good to threatened species 
	D．scientists still need more researches to establish EDGE priority areas

Life rules the series 56UP tells us
1．Life goes on.
Through the years，we've seen the participants experience deaths，divorce，and dramatic career setbacks.__16__ We've also seen them walk out from adversity.Over and over，we've seen the participants believe negative events meant their lives were finished.But people will gradually return to their personal “baseline” of happiness after a triumph or a tragedy.
2．Count your blessings.
__17__ Neil，for example，suffers severe mental illness and has been homeless and suicidal for long stretches of time.But Neil also provides the audience with many moments of grace，as when he recounts how grateful he is for long walks and conversations with friends.This sense of gratitude contributes powerfully to the resilience self－cure of Neil.People who live a life of thankfulness really do experience life differently than people who cheat themselves out of life by not feeling grateful.
3．__18__
“At 56，for people who put energy into families，there was a big payback，” said Michael Apted.Again and again，the “Up” series reveals how important friends，family，and social connections are to an individual's success and happiness in life.For both men and women，caring for others invested their lives with a meaning that they weren't able to find in any other activity.
4．__19__
The series does，in fact，show that money matters.But the research also shows that once we secure food，shelter，and a minimum level of comfort，happiness springs from life meaning and relationships much more than money.
5．Don't compare yourself to others.
Yes，research does find that inequality makes us unhappy—but it turns out that this has little to do with the amounts of money.__20__ We hurt ourselves with comparisons to others，but we can't seem to stop.Remember that each life must be judged on its own terms.
A．Relationships matter a lot.
B．It's the comparisons that hurt.
C．Money also matters but only up to a point.
D．They are putting confidence in themselves.
E．Whatever happened in life，they go ahead bravely.
F．Remember that you can expect the best in return in your life.
G．Participants in the series are among the most grateful for what they have.

Different students have different opinions on if senior students should have classes on weekend.
Some students think that good for them.First，as senior students，they must have enough time to prepare for the College Entrance Examination，which is of great important for them.Second，some of the students lack self－control when they have no class at weekends.
In a contrast，others think it is not useful.Students need quality education instead good scores but low qualities.Beside，a two－day weekend gives students more time to go outdoors，when they can relax and develop individual interests.
As far as I am concern，study and rest are both important for students.Studying is as important as widen our social activities.

    New Zealand is made up of two main islands that lie in the South Pacific Ocean. Mountains, glaciers and volcanoes make the islands beautiful to visit and explore.
Auckland
    Auckland was first settled by Maori tribes around 1350. By the time European settlers arrived in 1840, it was almost deserted.  Today, Auckland is New Zealand’s largest and fastest growing city. Located between two coasts, Auckland has many harbors and is said to have the most pleasure boats per person of any city in the world. The Sky Tower is the city’s most distinctive landmark. At 1,076 feet tall, the tower is the tallest building in the southern hemisphere（半球）!
Wellington
    Wellington is New Zealand’s capital city. It is home to the Parliament building and many other cultural treasures. The city rests between rolling green hills and a wide waterfront. A highlight of the city’s arts, cultural and historical attractions is Te Papa, the national museum. It is one of the largest national museums in the world and holds many Maori pieces, including a carved meetinghouse. It also displays the original Treaty of Waitangi.

Aoraki/Mount Cook is where famous New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary trained before he made his historic trip up Mount Everest.

    A famous psychological expert also talked about her feelings after reading Fang’s book at the event.

    There’s nothing like a wagging（摇摆）tail to cheer you up after a bad day. Science even shows that dogs may reduce feelings of anxiety and loneliness.  But our furry friends don’t only contribute to our good moods—they might even be able to recognize them. New research shows that dogs may be able to tell when we’re happy just by looking at our faces.
    The study, published in the journal Current Biology, rewarded a group of dogs for recognizing both happy and angry faces. Each dog was individually shown only the eyes, the mouths, or the left half of the faces of smiling and angry humans. One group of animals saw the same faces they were trained with, and the others were given new faces to look at during the test. In the study, scientists rewarded half of the dogs for recognizing happy faces and the other half for recognizing angry ones.
    In their results, the scientists saw one main trend: The dogs who were rewarded for the smiling faces learned to distinguish between the two feelings faster than the ones that were rewarded for frowning faces. The paper points out that we’d expect these outcomes if the dogs had been punished when shown the angry faces, but they were actually rewarded for both frowning and smiling faces. The bottom line? The results of the study may be a sign that dogs not only notice
a difference in our facial expressions, but might even understand them to a certain extent. So next time you see your dog wagging his tail, go ahead and smile back.
29. What does the word “them” in Paragraph 1 refer to?
A. anxiety and loneliness               B. dogs’ owners
    C. dogs                             D. our good moods
30. Why are a group of dogs rewarded according to the study published in Current Biology?
    A. They can wag their tails.
    B. They can make their owners happy.
    C. They can recognize both happy and angry faces.
    D. They can remember the shown eyes and mouths.
31. What is the passage mainly about?
A. Our dogs know when we’re happy.
    B. During the test, all the dogs were given new faces to look at.
    C. The dogs rewarded for the frowning faces learned to distinguish the two feelings faster.
D. The results of the study prove that dogs understand our facial expressions to a certain extent.

SAN FRANCISCO（AP）—Samsung says new Galaxy Note 7 smartphones will be available in U. S.  stores starting Wednesday to replace about 1 million devices that are being recalled because their batteries can catch fire.
    The South Korean company has been scrambling to fix problems caused by faulty batteries in the latest version of its top-of-the-line smartphone, which first went on sale last month.
    When it first offered on Sept. 2 to replace the affected Note 7 phones, Samsung said it would swap them for models of its other phones, such as the Galaxy S7, until supplies of replacement Note 7 devices became available.
    Samsung followed up last week by announcing that U.S. consumers who had purchased one of the recalled phones could choose between a replacement or a refund for the device, which sells for about $850. That offer was jointly announced with officials at the U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission after Samsung was criticized for not coordinating more closely with the commission.
    Safety officials have urged Note 7 owners to turn off their phones and return them immediately. They cited reports of Note 7 batteries overheating in the United States, including 26 instances where individuals were burned and 55 that caused property damage.
The problem doesn’t affect all Note 7 phones, because Samsung uses batteries from different suppliers. But the company has said about 2.5 million devices may he affected worldwide, including 1 million sold in the United States.
    Samsung also said it’s pushing out two software updates through wireless carriers. One will show a green battery icon to confirm that a Note 7 device is a new one that doesn’t have the battery problem.  The other will display a short notice to owners of older phones covered by the recall, telling them to turn off their device and take it in for a replacement.
    About a quarter of affected phones had been exchanged in the United States by Tuesday, according to a spokeswoman for Samsung’s U. S.  subsidiary. She was unable to say how many Note 7 buyers sought refunds, but said “the vast majority” received a different Samsung phone as a replacement.
32. What’s wrong with the affected Note 7 phones?
A. The price of them is too high.         B. Their batteries can catch fire.
    C. They are similar to iphone 7.
    D. They have problems with their earphones.
33. What can a U.S. consumer who had purchased one of the recalled phones do according to Samsung’s announcement?
    A. To sell his/her recalled phone to others for about $ 850.
    B. To choose a replacement and a refund for his/her recalled phone.
    C. To return the recalled phone and get a replacement or a refund（about $ 850）for the device.
    D. To use the recalled phone to replace a Galaxy S7 first and then one of the new Note 7 devices for free.
34. How many affected phones had been exchanged in the United States by Tuesday?
    A. About 0.25 million.                 B. About 0. 625 million.
    C. About 0. 875 million.               D. About 1 million.
35. What can we learn from the passage?
    A. The Galaxy S7 devices are the safest.
    B. The Note 7 phones sold in China are safe.
    C. The Note 7 phones used batteries from different suppliers never have the same problems.
    D. At least 81 cases of Note 7 batteries overheating were reported in the United States.

Tips to Fight Allergies（过敏症）
About one in five people suffer from some kind of allergy, according to a new survey. Seasonal allergies are the most common. While not as severe as food and insect allergies, they can interfere with daily life. Here are some tips to fight allergies.
●  36    At least you should wash fruits carefully. When possible, cook fruits and/or avoid eating fruit peels （皮）. Symptoms of pollen-food （花粉食品）allergy syndrome typically occur when you eat fruit—including its peel—in its raw form. So by peeling or cooking fruit, you can lessen or completely avoid any reaction.
    ● Keep your hair clean.   37   Hair gels and pastes cause the hair to become a pollen magnet（磁铁）.
    ●  38   Going to bed swaddled in the pollen and mold that your clothing, skin, and hair picked up throughout the day may be the problem. If you can’t bathe at night, make sure you at least wash your face at night, giving your eye area some special attention.
    ● Stay inside during and directly after thunderstorms and keep house windows shut.   39__   However, thunderstorms actually stir up pollen.
    ● Bath your dog regularly and avoid allowing your pet to lay in bed with you. Just because that you aren’t allergic to your pet doesn’t mean that they won’t make you sneeze and sniffle.    __40  
    A. Wash fruits thoroughly.
    B. If possible, bathe at night.
    C. Pollen is the biggest cause of allergies.
    D. Gentle drizzles（毛毛细雨）can decrease pollen counts.
    E. Use as few hair products as possible or wash hair every day.
    F. A long, cold winter has worsened seasonal allergies for many people.
    G. After being outside, your dog can bring pollen, mold, and other allergens into your home.

The first Memorial Day was observed on May 30，1866 in Columbus，Georgia by women's groups who decorated the graves of soldiers with flowers.In 1868，General John Logan (a member of the Senate[参议院] at the time)，officially made Memorial Day a holiday to honor soldiers who had died in the Civil War.After World War I，the holiday didn't just honor those who died fighting in the Civil War but honored all Americans who died fighting in any war.Although the majority of the country celebrates Memorial Day on the last Monday in May，some southern states celebrate it on different days.
Since the late 1950s，the 1，200 soldiers of the 3rd US Infantry(步兵团) put small American flags on every grave (there are about 260，000 of them) at Arlington National Cemetery on the Thursday before Memorial Day.They then patrol(巡逻) the graveyard 24 hours a day during the weekend to make sure that every flag remains standing.On the Saturday before Memorial Day，the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts place a candle at each grave (there are about 15，300 of them) at the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park on Marye's Heights.They've been doing this since 1998.

You may be familiar with some of ancient Chinese musical instruments called Erhu or Guzheng，but you may be not familiar with some other ancient Chinese music instruments，such as the Hujia.These instruments are gradually dying out because of a lack of attention and preservation for them.But now，a young man in Northeast China's Shenyang City is hoping to change that.
Liu Da was born in Shenyang City，Liaoning Province，China and graduated from Tchaikovsky Music University in Ukraine two years ago，where he majored in piano.But rather than a pianist，Liu is now more like a carpenter for most of the day.And it's all for one thing：to recreate the musical instruments of ancient China.
“In Ukraine，during major festivals，the artists from around the world would dress up in their own traditional clothes and use their own musical instruments to play.I had an opportunity to see a lot of music instruments in these festivals.So I was inspired to present our culture，our music as well，from where I'm from，” Liu said.
Liu Da started to recreate ancient Chinese music instruments after he graduated from university.It usually takes him between six to eight months to make one ancient instrument.Liu Da has even learned the Manchu and Mongolian language，so he could consult historic files to make accurate designs.
During the last two years，he has recreated 23 different kinds of musical instruments from ancient China，some dating back over thousands of years.“This musical instrument is called a Hujia，a reed ripe(牧笛)．It dates back to 3，000 B．C. It's very old and it has a very interesting history，” Liu Da said.
Liu Da's next plan is to form a band with these 23 instruments to get an authentic flavor for ancient music.
5．Why are some ancient Chinese musical instruments dying out?
	A．They have lost their value in the modern society.
	B．People in China are not able to play them.

Look At Yourself—Really look at yourself.Stand in front of your mirror and take a good look.This is really hard for a lot of kids to do，but try—it's important.That's your face that you're looking at and your face is going to be with you for a long time，so it would be really helpful if you would stop worrying so much about it and start liking it.Learning to look at yourself in the mirror and accepting all the good and not so good things about your face is an important step in feeling more comfortable with you and then，with everyone else.
Practice—It needs practice to make your face look perfect.But，if you look at other people's faces，you will see that no one looks perfect.You may think your favorite singer or actor looks perfect，but everyone's idea of perfection is different.Your job is to start seeing the beautiful things about you.It needs practice.You might notice that the expression on your face makes a big difference in how you look.
Dress for Comfort—It's important that clothes make you feel physically and emotionally comfortable.Clothes say a great deal about the person who's wearing them.Kids who want to get along well with others should wear clothes that are similar to what their classmates are wearing.Kids who wear very different clothes can't be welcomed by other kids.
Hygiene(卫生)—Now that you've paid attention to your face and your clothes，let's work on cleaning.The simple fact is that if a kid smells bad and has dirty teeth，other kids and grown－ups won't want to come too close.

Scientists pinpointed areas of the world where Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) mammals and amphibians(两栖动物) occur.Regions containing the highest concentrations of these species are highlighted as global conservation priorities.
The map reveals that high priority conservation areas for mammals and amphibians are different，reflecting the varied evolutionary histories and threats facing the two groups.For mammals，management efforts are best focused in Southeast Asia，southern Africa and Madagascar.For amphibians，Central and southern America are highlighted as priorities.
Professor Jonathan Baillie says: “The results of the mapping exercise are alarming.Currently only five percent of the areas we've identified as priorities for EDGE mammals and 15 percent of the EDGE amphibian areas are protected.These areas highlighted should all be global conservation priorities because they contain species that are not only highly threatened but also unique in the way they look，live and behave.These new maps will inform the development of larger－scale work to help secure the future of some of the most remarkable species on Earth.” 
Madagascar's black－and－white ruffed lemur(狐猴) is the largest lemur in the world and is threatened by hunting and the loss of its forest habitat to logging，mining and cutting and burning for agriculture.The Sunda pangolin(穿山甲)，occurs in Southeast Asia and is threatened by illegal hunting for its meat，as well as its scales which are thought to have high medicinal value.Other mammal species occurring in priority areas include the black rhino and western lowland gorilla.
Amphibians are facing a terrifying rate of extinction making them the most threatened animals in the world.The Mexican salamander(火蜥蜴)is critically endangered due to urbanization(城市化)，polluted waters，and the introduction of non－native fish which eat the axolotl's young.With the aid of the global map of EDGE amphibians，it will now be possible to concentrate efforts in countries such as，Mexico，Costa Rica and Guatemala where the most distinct and threatened species are found.
Professor Jonathan Baillie says：“This is the first global map to take into account species' uniqueness as well as threat.Now that we've identified EDGE priority areas for mammals and amphibians we can more effectively continue to ensure their protection.”
13．Which of the following can be the best title for the passage?
	A．Most mammals and amphibians in the world become extinct
	B．Conservation areas should be set up in more and more areas
	C．World's most extraordinary species mapped for the first time
	D．The most rare and threatened animals in the world were identified
	14．The method the writer uses to develop Paragraphs 4 and 5 is ________．
	A．offering analyses
	B．giving examples
	C．providing explanations
	D．making comparisons
	15．It can be known from the passage that ________．
	A．conservation areas for mammals and amphibians are almost the same
	B．human activities are the largest threat to mammals and amphibians
	C．the global map of EDGE amphibians does no good to threatened species 
	D．scientists still need more researches to establish EDGE priority areas

Life rules the series 56UP tells us
1．Life goes on.
Through the years，we've seen the participants experience deaths，divorce，and dramatic career setbacks.__16__ We've also seen them walk out from adversity.Over and over，we've seen the participants believe negative events meant their lives were finished.But people will gradually return to their personal “baseline” of happiness after a triumph or a tragedy.
2．Count your blessings.
__17__ Neil，for example，suffers severe mental illness and has been homeless and suicidal for long stretches of time.But Neil also provides the audience with many moments of grace，as when he recounts how grateful he is for long walks and conversations with friends.This sense of gratitude contributes powerfully to the resilience self－cure of Neil.People who live a life of thankfulness really do experience life differently than people who cheat themselves out of life by not feeling grateful.
3．__18__
“At 56，for people who put energy into families，there was a big payback，” said Michael Apted.Again and again，the “Up” series reveals how important friends，family，and social connections are to an individual's success and happiness in life.For both men and women，caring for others invested their lives with a meaning that they weren't able to find in any other activity.
4．__19__
The series does，in fact，show that money matters.But the research also shows that once we secure food，shelter，and a minimum level of comfort，happiness springs from life meaning and relationships much more than money.
5．Don't compare yourself to others.
Yes，research does find that inequality makes us unhappy—but it turns out that this has little to do with the amounts of money.__20__ We hurt ourselves with comparisons to others，but we can't seem to stop.Remember that each life must be judged on its own terms.
A．Relationships matter a lot.
B．It's the comparisons that hurt.
C．Money also matters but only up to a point.
D．They are putting confidence in themselves.
E．Whatever happened in life，they go ahead bravely.
F．Remember that you can expect the best in return in your life.
G．Participants in the series are among the most grateful for what they have.

Different students have different opinions on if senior students should have classes on weekend.
Some students think that good for them.First，as senior students，they must have enough time to prepare for the College Entrance Examination，which is of great important for them.Second，some of the students lack self－control when they have no class at weekends.
In a contrast，others think it is not useful.Students need quality education instead good scores but low qualities.Beside，a two－day weekend gives students more time to go outdoors，when they can relax and develop individual interests.
As far as I am concern，study and rest are both important for students.Studying is as important as widen our social activities.

A
“I Went Skydiving at 84!”
As a young girl growing up in the 1930s, I always wanted to fly a plane, but back then it was almost unheard of for a woman to do that. I got a taste of the dream in 2001, when my husband arranged for me to ride in a hot air balloon for my birthday. But the experience turned out to be very dull. Around that time, I told my husband that I wanted to skydive. So when our retirement community announced that they were having an essay competition and the topic was an experience of a lifetime that you wanted to have. I decided to write about my dream.
    In the essay, I wrote about my desire to skydive, stating Gorge Bush Sr. did it at age 80. Why not me? I was just 84 and in pretty good health . A year went by and I heard nothing. But then at a community party in late April 2009, they announced that I was one of the winners. I just couldn’t believe it. Inspired by this. I decided to realize my dream, even though some of my family members and my doctor were against it.
On June 11,2009, nearly 40 of my family and friends gathered in the area close to where I would land while I headed up in the airplane. My instructor, Jay, guided me through the experience. The plane was the noisiest one I had ever been in, but I wasn’t frightened-I was really just looking forward to the experience. When we reached 13,000 feet, Jay instructed me to throw myself out of the plane. When we first hit the air, the wind was so strong that I could hardly breathe. For a second I thought, “What have I gotten myself into?” But then everything got calmer. We were in a free fall for about a minute before Jay opened the parachute (降落伞), then we just floated downward for about five minutes . Being up in the clouds and looking at the view below was unlike anything I have ever felt-much better than the hot air balloon. I was just enjoying it.
Skydiving was really one of the greatest experiences of my life. I hope other people will look at me and really one of the greatest experiences of my life. I hope other people will look at me and realize that you don’t stop living just because you are 84 years old. If there’s something you want to experience, look into it. If it’s something that is possible, make it happen.
1. What happened to the author in 2001?
A. She flew an airplane.
B. She entered a competition.
C. She went on a hot air balloon ride.
D. She moved into a retirement community.
2. The author mentioned George Bush Sr. in the essay to _______.     .
A. build up her own reputation
B. show her admiration for him
C. compare their health condition
D. make her argument persuasive
3. How did the author feel immediately after she jumped out of the plane?
A. Excited.	B. Scared.	C. Nervous	D. Regretful

Students and Technology in the Classroom
I love my Blackberry—it’s my little connection to the larger world that can go anywhere with me. I also love my laptop computer, as it holds all of my writing and thoughts. Despite this love of technology, I know that there are times when I need to move away from there devices(设备)and truly communicate with others.
On occasion, I teach a course called History Matters for a group of higher education managers. My goals for the class include a full discussion of historical themes and ideas. Because I want students to thoroughly study the material and exchange their ideas with each other in the classroom, I have a rule—no laptops, iPads, etc. When students were told my rule in advance of the class, some of them were not happy.
Most students assume that my reasons for this rule include unpleasant experiences in the past with students misusing technology. There’s a bit of truth to that. Some students assume that I am anti-technology. There’s no truth in that at all. I love technology and try to keep up with it so I can relate to my students.
The real reason why I ask students to leave technology at the door is that I think there are very few places in which we can have deep conversations and truly engage complex ideas. Interruptions by technology often break concentration and allow for too much dependence on out information for ideas. I want students to dig deep within themselves for inspiration and ideas. I want them to push each other to think differently and to make connections between the course material and the class discussion.
I’ve been teaching my history class in this way for many years and the evaluations reflect student satisfaction with the environment that I create. Students realize that with deep conversation and challenge, they learn at a level that helps them keep the course material beyond the classroom
I’m not saying that I won’t ever change my mind about technology use in my history class, but until I hear a really good reason for the change, I’m sticking to my plan. A few hours of technology-free dialogue is just too sweet to give up.
5. Some of the students in the history class were unhappy with _______.
A. the course material
B. others’ misuse of technology
C. discussion topics
D. the author’s class regulations
6. The underlined word “engage” in Para.4 probably means ________.      .
A. explore
B. accept
C. change
D. reject
7. According to the author, the use of technology in the classroom may ________.       .
A. keep students from doing independent thinking
B. encourage students to have in-depth conversations
C. help students to better understand complex themes
D. affect students’ concentration on course evaluation
8. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that the author_______.
A. is quite stubborn
B. will give up teaching history
C. will change his teaching plan soon
D. values technology-free dialogues in his class

C
 “Have a nice day” may be a pleasant gesture or a meaningless expression. When my friend Maxie says “Have a nice day” with a smile, I know she sincerely cares about what happens to me. I feel loved and secure since another person cares about me and wishes me well.  
“Have a nice day. Next!” The version of the expression is spoken by a salesgirl at supermarket who is rushing me and my groceries out the door. The words came out in the same tone (腔调) with a fixed procedure. They are spoken at me, not to me. Obviously, the concern for my day and everyone else’s is the management’s attempt to increase business.
The expression is one of those behaviors that help people get along with each other. Sometimes it indicates the end of a meeting. As soon as you hear it, you know the meeting at an end. Sometimes the expression saves us when we don’t know what to say. “Oh, you just had a tooth out? I’m terribly sorry, but have a nice day”
The expression can be pleasant. If a stranger says “Have a nice day” to you, you may find it heart-warming because someone you don’t know has tried to be nice to you.
Although the use of the expression is insincere, meaningless social custom at times, there is nothing wrong with the sentence except that it is a little uninteresting. The salesgirl, the waitress, the teacher, and the countless others who speak it without thinking may not really care about my day. But in a strange and comfortable way, it’s nice to know they care enough to pretend they care when they really don’t care all that much. While the expression may not often be sincere, it is always spoken The point is that people say it all the time when they like.
9. How does the author understand Maxie’s words?   
A. Maxie shows her anxiety to the author.  
B. Maxie really wishes the author a good day.
C. Maxie encourages the author to stay happy.
D. Maxie really worries about the author’s security.
10. What does the underlined sentence in Paragraph 2 mean?
A. The salesgirl is rude.
B. The salesgirl is bored.
C. The salesgirl cares about me.
D. The salesgirl says the words as a routine.
11. By saying “Have a nice day”, a stranger may _____.
A. try to be polite to you
B. express respect to you
C. give his blessing to you
D. share his pleasure with you
12. According to the last paragraph, people say “Have a nice day” _______.
A. sincerely
B. as thanks
C. as a habit
D. encouragingly

D
     I was blind, but I was ashamed of it if it was known. I refused to use a white stick and hated asking for help. After all, I was a teenage girl, and I couldn’t bear people to look at me and think I was not like them. I must have been a terrible danger on the roads, Coming across me wandering through the traffic, motorists probably would have to step rapidly on their brakes. Apart from that, there were all sorts of disasters that used to occur on the way to and from work.
One evening, I got off the bus about halfway home where I had to change buses, and as usual I ran into something, “I’m awfully sorry,” I said and stepped forward only to run into it again. When it happened a third time, I realized I had been apologizing to a lamppost. This was just one of the stupid things that constantly happened to me. So I carried on and found the bus stop, which was a request stop, where the bus wouldn’t stop unless passengers wanted to get on or off. No one else was there and I had to try to guess if the bus had arrived.
Generally in this situation, because I hated showing I was blind by asking for help, I tried to guess at the sound. Sometimes I would stop a big lorry and stand there feeling stupid as it drew away. In the end, I usually managed to swallow my pride and ask someone at the stop for help.
But on this particular evening no one joined me at the stop; It seemed that everyone had suddenly decided not to travel by bus. Of course I heard plenty of buses pass, or I thought I did. But because I had given up stopping them for fear of making a fool of myself, I let them all go by. I stood there alone for half an hour without stopping one. Then I gave up. I decided to walk on to the next stop.
13. The girl refused to ask for help because she thought_________.
A. she might be recognized
B. asking for help looked silly
C. she was normal and independent
D. being fond blind was embarrassing
14. After the girl got off the bus that evening, she_________.
A. began to run
B. hit a person as usual
C. hit a lamppost by accident
D. was caught by something
15. At the request stop that evening, the girl___________.
A. stopped a big lorry
B. stopped the wrong bus
C .made no attempt to stop the bus
D. was not noticed by other people

A Man and His Word
In a used furniture business, unlike new, you cannot order stock (存货) from a catalogue. People call in, and you have to go out and make an offer. “You can’t   21__   what you don’t have.” my father would say.
    When I was aged thirteen, my father lost his store   22  , a one-armed guy who could do more with his one arm than many will do with two. With his manager gone, my father came to me. “Will you come in while I go out to  23  the day’s calls until I find the   __24 _  person?” he asked.
    The store has tens of thousands of   25  . “People like to bargain,” he told me, “So I don’t   26   prices. You just have to know a   27   .”
    He took me around. “A quarter-horse motor you can sell for four dollars. For a refrigerator, depending on the  _28_ , you can sell for thirty-five dollars to sixty dollars. However, if it has a freezer that goes well, sell it for eighty dollars, in   29   condition, maybe one hundred dollars. Dishes come in with a houseful of furniture, and I don’t even   30   them in when I give a price. You can sell them for a cent to a dollar. Something really nice.”
Every day after   31  , I would ride to the store. Soon after, I was writing up a sales slip（纸条）for an attractive plate when my father walked in. I had asked a dollar and the guy did not  32  .

It turned out that it was an antique plate, worth a few hundred dollars. I was   35  . Here I was   36   to help my father in the business and instead I was losing money for him.
He said, “I could’ve   37   the sales if I’d wanted to. You were just writing up the slip and hadn’t yet taken the money. Besides, by civil law, you’re under   38  . But, a man stands by his word and the word of his   39  .”

   The biggest challenge I have overcome is stepping out of my comfort zone. In the year of 2013 which I was 15, I joined an exchange student program. I sent to Germany alone and lived with the host family.
   At first it was a huge failure for me. Thanks for my host mom, she helped me a lot. She told me some tips to make friends, such as joining a sports club and invited my classmates to watch a movie. Surprising, all of the tips she gave me work out! She also suggested that I can introduce my culture to my classmates. To my astonish, they were both interested in Chinese culture.

	I went to the cinema this afternoon to see La La Land. Before going into he screening my sister and I visited the ladies’ washroom. As we entered, a little blonde haired girl about 5 years of age opened one of the cubicle(小隔间) doors, hot pants in hand and looking upset and overwhelmed, she ran out of the washroom.
	I went after her. Her dad was standing outside. She quickly gave him the hot pants to dress her. Little sweetheart. She obviously couldn't manage to button up her hot pants. Even though she had her little white tights on, she must have felt embarrassed about the lack of hot pants.
	I tried to calm and reassure her, saying, “When I saw dad standing outside I knew he was waiting for someone very pretty, but I just hadn't realized how, pretty she was going to be.”She didn't bite; dad smiled though. I offered to bring her back to wash her hands.
	She was too tiny to squeeze soap out of the dispenser, so I helped her. I could see poor dad out of the side of my eyes. He was right at the door looking in. I went with her to the hand dryer, but she was so tiny that the sensor couldn't even detect her little hands. I lifted her up and her hands were properly dried, well at least a little.
	I was moved by this little girl’s helplessness in an adult world. I also felt for dad having to trust that his little girl would feel safe and secure for the few minutes out of his sight.
	I reached out for help. I tried to bridge the gap when a little helpless girl was a few minutes without a trusted adult and a concerned father had to for a moment accept he could not give her the security he wanted for her. It wasn't much but it helped a caring father and his little daughter and for that, I'm grateful.
5.Why did the little girl catch the author's attention?
	A. She got frightened by strangers						B. She needed clothing to cover her
	C. She was probably lost in the crowd					D. She was in an embarrassing situation
6.Why did the hand dryer fail to work for the little girl?

	A. Helpless				B. Shy					C. Shameful				D. Calm

	If you believe in thermometers(温度计), you should believe in global warming. And if you believe in eating fries with your burger, you should worry more about carbon emissions.
	It won't happen overnight, but as the planet's climate changes, the growth cycles of main crops will all be heavily affected. Here are three of the crops that might not beat the heat.
	The potato actually needs a great deal of beauty rest to develop properly. “They need a cool nighttime temperature in order to start growing the tuber, the part that we eat,” Nelson says.
	Temperature and altitude are two primary concerns in coffee growth, and farmers are stuck between a rock and a hard place.“We know that coffee grows in a certain temperature range,” Nelson says.“They've been moving up the mountains, but at some paint you run out of mountains to move up.”Higher-grade strains of Arabica coffee in Central American regions are at particular risk due to the need for lower growing temperature, especially since diseases and pests are also becoming more of a factor as temperatures rise.
	Even if you're looking at the direct effects of temperature alone, rice is in trouble.“As nighttime temperatures go up, the rice is going to have a problem flowering and won't make as many seeds,” Nelson says. In addition to this direct heat consequence, rising sea levels will flood many rice fields and destroy water salinity levels, while droughts will lower production, raise prices, and further shame westerners who are too clumsy with chopsticks to be able to clear their plates once a new grain is adopted.
8.What is the closest meaning to the underlined word “emissions” in Paragraph 1?
	A. Mixture				B. Pollution				C. Going down			D. Letting off
9.What does the potatoes' development need according to Nelson?
	A. Enough water and salt							B. Cool temperature at night.
	C. Much sunshine and fresh air						D. Sudden rise of the temperature
10.The rice is difficult to flower, probably because     .
	A. sea levels go up suddenly							B. the temperature rises at night
	C. many seeds can't be produced						D. both temperature and altitude rise
11.What is the best title for the text?
	A. How Does Global Warming Affect Westerners
	B. How Does The Cool Temperature Affect Ride
	C. What Is The Real Reason For Crops' Growth
	D. Three Crops That Won't Survive Minor Climate Changes
D
	Before you walked down the aisle-if you even did-did you first agree to take your partner's name? Had you agreed to the bank for updated credit cards, changed your email address, and updated your Facebook?
	I didn't; and I know plenty of women out there didn't, either. So I was pretty shocked to learn that in a recent survey, over 50 percent of U.S. citizens believe a wife should take her husband's name—and she should be required to do so by law.
	Author Emily Schafer, a sociology professor at Portland State University, surveyed a representative national sample of 1,200 people tar the study, which found that a larger number of American adults think there needs to actually be a law in place to prevent women from keeping their own name.
	The most common reason given? The general belief is that women should prioritize(优先) their marriage and their family ahead of themselves. To this, I admit I'm a bit confused, because I don't understand how exactly riot taking your husband’s last name means you aren't prioritizing your marriage.
	Now, I didn't take my husband's name for a variety of reasons: I didn’t feel like the name was "mine" and professionally I had built up a reputation as a writer under my maiden(未婚的) name, so I didn't want to lose that. His surname wasn't easy to spell, either; everyone gets it wrong(including my mother-still-and we've been married 13 years). But most of all, I felt like in taking my husband's last name, I was losing a huge sense of self. And while yes, we are a family, I don't want his surname to define me. I'm not his possession.
	Just like every aspect of motherhood, each woman should be respected for the choices she makes-without having to do anything by law. And we should all be grateful to Lucy Stone-the first American woman to legally maintain her last name after marriage in 1856.Just imagine how difficult that must have been to forego tradition in that time?
12.What can be learned about the tradition of taking a husband's name from the survey?
	A. A law should be there to break the tradition
	B. The majority of American adults support the tradition
	C. The majority of American women go against the tradition
	D. The law requires wives to take their husbands' names in America
13.Why does an American woman generally take her husband's name?
	A. To value her marriage and family
	B. To show honesty to her husband
	C. To join in the family of her husband
	D. To unite a new family under the same name
14.What can we learn from Paragraph 5?
	A. Why the author didn't use her husband's name
	B. Why the author's mother didn't like her husband
	C. How worthy the author's own maiden name was
	D. How bored the author became with her husband's name.
15.What's the author's attitude towards the tradition?
	A. It's reasonable									B. It needs no care
	C. Every coin has two sides							D. It's out of date and confusing

Four Questions to Ask Before Choosing a Travel Agent
	While online booking engines have made it easier for travelers to buy their own flights or hotel rooms, travel agents still offer a level of service.  16  
	Have you visited my destination?
	Whether you're traveling to Paris or Puerto Rico, ask if your agent has been there.  17  But they don't always measure up to being there in person."Book knowledge or online training seminars by suppliers is totally different from experiencing it firsthand,” Flagg says.
	What Is your response time?
	If waiting several days for a response to an emailed question is going to make you anxious, ask potential agents when they're available and how quickly you should expect a response. “Some agents are part-time agents, and they work in the evenings,” Griswold says.“  18  Others do this full time. It's definitely smart to find out if your schedule can adjust with what your agent can provide.”
	  19  
	Agents provide varying levels of service. Some will only book hotels and flights and leave you to fill in the other details, so if you're expecting help with dinner reservations or ground transportation, ask if he can handle those. “A good agent is going to help you with any details that you want,” Griswold says
	What fees should I expect?
	Some agents charge a flat lee or an hourly fee for travel-consulting, while others earn commission from the airline or hotel booked.”  20  ” Griswold says.
	A. What services do you offer?
	B. How do you find a right service?
	C. Some are available during the school day.
	D. Guidebooks and websites offer lots of advertisements.
	E. Ask about fees, whether there are booking fees or any other fee.
	F. Guidebooks and websites offer lots of detail on a given destination.
	G. Here are some questions that, can help you choose the right travel agent.

Stanley Yelnats was given a choice. The judge said, “You may go to prison, or you may go to Camp Green Lake.” Stanley was from a poor family. He had never been to camp before. So, Stanley Yelnats seems set to serve an easy sentence, which is only fair because he is as innocent as you or me. But Stanley is not going where he thinks he is.
Camp Green Lake is like no other camp anywhere. It is a place that has no lake and nothing green. Nor is it a camp, at least not the kind of camp kids look forward to in the summertime. It is only a desert wasteland, dotted with countless holes dug by the boys who live at the camp.
The trouble started when Stanley was accused of stealing a pair of shoes donated by basketball great Clyde “Sweetfeet” Livingston to a celebrity auction (名流拍卖会). In court, the judge doesn’t believe Stanley’s explanation that the shoes fell from the sky onto his head. And yet, that’s exactly what happened. Strangely, though, Stanley doesn’t blame the 
judge for falsely convicting (宣告有罪  ) him. Instead, he blames the whole thing on his 
“no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather.” Thanks to this distant relative, the Yelnats family had been cursed (诅咒) for generations. For Stanley, his current troubles are just a natural part of being a Yelnats.
At Camp Green Lake, the warden (看守) makes the boys “build character” by spending all day, every day, digging holes: five feet wide and five feet deep. It doesn’t take long for Stanley to realize there’s more than character improvement going on at Camp Green Lake. The boys are digging holes because the warden is searching for something, and before long Stanley begins his own search — for the truth. Fate is to find a solution to it all — the family curse, the mystery of the holes. The great wheel of justice has ground slowly for generations, but now it is about to reveal its verdict (裁决).

24. Stanley Yelnats went to Camp Green Lake to _____.
A. serve his sentence 						B. make a choice
C. enjoy the summertime					D. show his innocence
25. We can learn from the passage that Stanley _____.
A. donated the shoes to an auction			B. blamed the judge for the sentence
C. stole the shoes for his relative			D. got the shoes by accident
26. In fact, the warden makes the boys dig holes to _____.
A. break the family curse 	 				B. look for something
C. kill the time							D. build character
27. What does the underlined sentence in Paragraph Three mean?
A. Everyone believes Stanley is born in a criminal family. 
B. Actually his relative’s stealing the shoes causes Stanley’s trouble. 
C. Stanley believes he deserves his troubles because of his stealing. 
D. Stanley thinks he is in trouble for being a member of his family. 
C
Cooking programs and classes for children seem to positively influence children’s food preferences and behaviors, according to a recent review. Although the review didn’t look at long-term effects of such programs, the findings suggest that such programs might help children develop long-lasting healthy habits.
This research comes at a time when childhood obesity（肥胖）rates have been rising rapidly. More than one-third of adolescents in the United States were obese in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This trend has been caused, at least in part, by a significant decrease in the amount of meals that people consume at home since the 1980s, according to background information in the study. 
Cooking education programs, such as Food Explorers, teach children about new healthy foods and how to prepare them. They also stress the importance of eating five fruits and vegetables every day. A volunteer parent explains a new food to the group, and the kids make something based on the lesson, such as fruit or vegetable salad. Depending on the program, kids may be sent home with information about healthy foods to bring to their parents, the review explained.
The study team reviewed eight other researches that tested different types of cooking education programs. Children in these classes were between 5 and 12 years old, according to the review. The goal of the study team was to learn more about developing an efficient program to encourage healthy food choices that last a lifetime. The study found that it is particularly important to expose kids to healthy foods on a number of occasions. This makes them feel comfortable with the new foods, which helps them build healthy habits.
The study stressed the importance of getting parents involved in their children’s eating habits. Parents who are unable to enroll their kids in a cooking class can achieve similar benefits by having their kids help them while they prepare meals at home. Children are more comfortable at home, which makes them more receptive to new foods because they will make the connection to a positive experience.

28. What can we infer from the second paragraph?
A. Childhood obesity rates have been rising rapidly since 2016
B. Food consumption has decreased significantly since the 1980s.
C. Eating out frequently may cause obesity in some sense.
D. Childhood obesity is totally caused by eating habits.
29. In cooking education programs, ________.
A. children may learn information unfamiliar to their parents
B. children focus more on cooking skills than on information about healthy foods
C. children learn how to prepare foods from their parents
D. children will learn how to cook in company with their parents
30. Which of the following is true according to the study? 
A. Children who participate in cooking programs are more likely to become obese.
B. Children should eat fruits and vegetables all the time. 
C. Parents should let their kids cook independently at home.
D. A greater willingness to try new foods helps building healthy habits.
31. Which of the following categories does this passage belong to?
A. Parent-child Relationship				B. Public Health Research
C. Education Systems	   					D. Science and Technology 

D
Loneliness is like a disease, and what’s worse, it’s infectious. It can spread from one person to another, according to the recent research that stresses the power of one person’s emotions to affect even people they don’t know.
The new analysis, involving 4,793 people who were interviewed every two years between 2006 and 2016, showed that a friend of a lonely person was 52% more likely to develop feelings of loneliness by the time of the next interview. A friend of that person was 25% more likely, and a friend of a friend of a friend was 15% more likely.
“Loneliness is not just the property of an individual. It can be transmitted across people—even people you don’t have direct contact with.” said John T. Cacioppo, a psychologist of University of Chicago who led the study published in the December issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.
Many factors can lead to loneliness, such as depression, sleep problems and generally poorer physical health. Identifying some of the causes could help reduce the emotion and improve health, experts said.
Although the study did not examine how loneliness spreads, Cacioppo said another research has provided clues. “Let’s say for whatever reason you get lonely. You then interact with other people in a more negative fashion. That puts them in a negative mood and makes them more likely to interact with other people in a negative fashion and they minimize their social ties and become lonely.” Cacioppo said.
According to Cacioppo, loneliness spread more easily among women than men, perhaps because women were more likely to express emotions.
Lonely people become less and less trusting others. This makes it more and more difficult for them to make friends—and more likely that society will reject them. Therefore, it is important to recognize and deal with loneliness. Cacioppo emphasizes people who have been pushed to the edges of society should receive help to repair their social networks.


32. It can be concluded from the second paragraph that ______. 
  A. more and more people are suffering from loneliness
  B. the more friends you make, the less lonely you feel
C. loneliness more likely spreads among close friends
  D. lonely persons are less willing to make friends
33. Which of the following is NOT mentioned in the passage? 
  A. Loneliness is a social problem.			B. The importance of studying loneliness.
  C. Certain causes of loneliness.				D. Loneliness is hard to cure.
34. What should lonely people do to get rid of loneliness? 
A. Interact with others more negatively.		B. Express emotions more often.
C. Refuse the help given by others. 			D. Admit and try to solve it.
35. Which of the following could be used as the topic of the passage?
A. Minimizing Social Ties       			B. Feeling Alone Or Not?
C. Loneliness Is Like a Disease           	D. Danger of Loneliness

With time going on, dogs have developed a special relationship with people. Recently, however, some dogs have taken a different role in people’s lives—therapy dogs.
       36    Some therapy dogs visit patients in hospitals or nursing homes, while others visit children in schools and libraries. They are there to help children become better readers.
Reading programs that use therapy dogs have been in existence for more than ten years. All therapy dogs of this program are registered with an organization that tests the dogs to make sure they have the right personality for the job.
       37    Both the dogs and the handlers are volunteers with the reading program.
At the start of a reading therapy session, a child and a dog are introduced. The pair is allowed to settle down in a quiet corner together.    38    An adult handler stays nearby but generally lets the dog perform its job without interfering(干涉). Sometimes, a handler may ask a question that encourages the child to work with the dog to help the child feel more comfortable. 
Not every child will be able to be part of a reading therapy program that uses dogs. A few children might be allergic to dogs or afraid of them; some children might have cultural traditions that prevent them from touching a dog.    39   
Reading therapy programs inspire learning and change for human beings.The readers benefit a lot, gaining confidence and learning that reading aloud can be a relaxing experience.
   40    They spend time with human friends. For dogs that love human companionship and a quiet place to rest, being part of a reading therapy program can be a great way to spend a few hours being with humans each day. 

  A. As the child reads, the dog usually lies quietly and listens.  
  B. A dog’s handler also takes a class and must pass a test to work in the therapy program.
  C. When reading to an animal, some children may become relaxed. 
  D. A therapy dog is more of a companion and is trained to help people in different ways.
  E.       But therapy animals also serve in many other areas.
  F.          In these circumstances, other animals are available, such as cats and parrots.
  G.     But how do the therapy dogs benefit from it?

Maria had to support herself and her son. She had been divorced (离婚) for ten years and was used to shopping for her son, who would be entering college in two years. Then she would only be shopping for herself. She felt sad when she thought of this. She hoped that he would choose a local college. Thus he could continue to live at home. She loved him, and feared the day when he would no longer be her daily companion (陪伴). 
     Maria drove to Costco, a store that sold food in bulk (批发) packages so that customers could save money. She parked her car far from the entrance of the store, which meant a longer walk, but it also meant she could leave faster. She got one of the big shopping baskets outside and pushed it into the store. Surprisingly, the store wasn’t all that crowded. 
     In the fruit section she sorted through nine packages of seedless green grapes before she found one that she liked. She carefully picked some bananas, apples, and other fruit, but she couldn’t find her son’s favorite type of oranges.

When my daughter was in the fifth grade, she came home from school almost every night with three or more hours of homework. It was my duty to help her get it done. One night she worked until midnight doing homework.
     I felt annoyed, but I didn’t want the teacher to think I was lazy, so I never complained. I wasn’t sure, but it seemed to me that five hours of homework was a bit too much for a fifth grade student.
     Later, I found out that parents and educators have discussed about homework for more than a century. Parents who like more homework want to give their children every advantage to succeed in today’s world. Some educators see homework as a way to help students perform better in tests.
     Other parents dislike the recent trend (趋势) toward more homework. They don’t want to stay up until midnight helping their children. They would prefer to spend their time going to the park or reading some really good books with their children. Added to the opposition are those who say that homework increases the gap (差距) between the rich and the poor, since middle class families do better when it comes to helping their children with their homework.
     So, who is right? Is homework an enemy or a help? According to experts the truth lies somewhere in the middle.
29. The author thought that her daughter’s homework ____.
 A. was too difficult                         B. was too much to finish
C. was done more carefully than her classmates   D. could be done as long as she studied harder
30. The author never complained to the teacher because ________.
A. she was too angry to talk with the teacher       B. she did not like complaining at all
C. she was afraid of being thought lazy by the teacher
D. her daughter would be annoyed if she complained
31. Some parents support the idea of giving more homework to children because _________.
A. they want to develop a good relationship with their children’s teachers 
B. they think it a good way to keep their children from spending all their time 
on the Internet 
C. they want to teach their children by themselves at home
D. they believe more homework will help children succeed in today’s society
32. What does the underlined sentence in the last paragraph probably mean?
A. Experts think middle school students should do lots of homework.
B. Experts haven’t come up with any idea to solve this problem.
C. Experts think homework should be given, but not too much.
D. Experts support the idea that homework is good for students.

India is a developing country. It has thousands of years of tradition and culture. Different types of people live in India. In the old days the educational institutions (教育机构) were called "ashramam" and teachers were "gurus". A guru was a respected person in society. 
     Now we are living in the technological world. Big changes are occurring in people’s living. The influence of television, telephone, radio, computer, Internet and mobile phones is very strong in everyday life. But even today, teachers are role models for students. Teaching is still a respectable job. But there are great changes in the education system. 
     One of the most obvious changes is that the influence of Western culture has increased. We are paying too much attention to doing business, just like the Western world. Teachers are likely to to be influenced by this too, but it is not good. Teachers are nation builders. The development of any country depends upon its education system. All types of development are possible through education.
     Another change has happened in the curriculum (课程). The curriculum connects the teacher and the student. While education is about learning, curriculum means the situations in which one learns. When we say that education deals with "what", then curriculum deals with "how" and "when". But at the moment, it is hard to say whether the curriculum is playing such a role. 
33. In India, an ashramam was _________.
 A. a teacher who was respected by people    B. a person who worked for the government
C. a place where students were taughtD. a place where tradition and culture developed
34. What is the author’s attitude towards educational change in India? 
A. He likes it.                         B. He is annoyed at it.
C. He is indifferent (冷漠的)to it. D. He is worried about it.
35. According to the passage, a curriculum _______.
 A. is the way that teachers teach         B. is a series of books
C. is activities and education            D. is organized by students

Everyone knows that fish is good for health. 36.  But it seems that many people don’t cook fish at home. Americans eat only about fifteen pounds of fish per person per year, but we eat twice as much fish in restaurants as at home. Buying, storing, and cooking fish isn’t difficult. 37. This text is about how to buy and cook fish in an easy way.
38.Fresh fish should smell sweet: you should feel that you’re standing at the ocean’s edge. Any fishy or strong smell means the fish isn’t fresh. 39.  When you have bought a fish and arrive home, you’d better store the fish in the fridge if you don’t cook it immediately, but fresh fish should be stored in your fridge for only a day or two. Frozen fish isn’t as tasty as the fresh one.
There are many common methods used to cook fish. 40. First, clean it and season it with  your  choice  of spices (调料).  Put  the  whole  fish  on  a plate and steam it in a steam pot for 8 to 10 minutes if it weighs about one pound. (A larger one will take more time.) Then, it’s ready to serve. 
A. Do not buy it.
B.  The easiest is to steam it.
C.  This is how you can do it.
D.  It just requires a little knowledge.
E.  The fish will go bad within hours.
F.  When buying fish, you should first smell it.
G.  The fats in fish are thought to help prevent heart disease.

Maria had to support herself and her son. She had been divorced (离婚) for ten years and was used to shopping for her son, who would be entering college in two years. Then she would only be shopping for herself. She felt sad when she thought of this. She hoped that he would choose a local college. Thus he could continue to live at home. She loved him, and feared the day when he would no longer be her daily companion (陪伴). 
     Maria drove to Costco, a store that sold food in bulk (批发) packages so that customers could save money.

She carefully picked some bananas, apples, and other fruit, but she couldn’t find her son’s favorite type of oranges.

When my daughter was in the fifth grade, she came home from school almost every night with three or more hours of homework. It was my duty to help her get it done. One night she worked until midnight doing homework.
     I felt annoyed, but I didn’t want the teacher to think I was lazy, so I never complained. I wasn’t sure, but it seemed to me that five hours of homework was a bit too much for a fifth grade student.
     Later, I found out that parents and educators have discussed about homework for more than a century. Parents who like more homework want to give their children every advantage to succeed in today’s world. Some educators see homework as a way to help students perform better in tests.
     Other parents dislike the recent trend (趋势) toward more homework. They don’t want to stay up until midnight helping their children. They would prefer to spend their time going to the park or reading some really good books with their children. Added to the opposition are those who say that homework increases the gap (差距) between the rich and the poor, since middle class families do better when it comes to helping their children with their homework.
     So, who is right? Is homework an enemy or a help? According to experts the truth lies somewhere in the middle.
29. The author thought that her daughter’s homework ____.
 A. was too difficult                         B. was too much to finish
C. was done more carefully than her classmates   D. could be done as long as she studied harder
30. The author never complained to the teacher because ________.
A. she was too angry to talk with the teacher       B. she did not like complaining at all
C. she was afraid of being thought lazy by the teacher
D. her daughter would be annoyed if she complained
31. Some parents support the idea of giving more homework to children because _________.
A. they want to develop a good relationship with their children’s teachers 
B. they think it a good way to keep their children from spending all their time 
on the Internet 
C. they want to teach their children by themselves at home
D. they believe more homework will help children succeed in today’s society
32. What does the underlined sentence in the last paragraph probably mean?
A. Experts think middle school students should do lots of homework.
B. Experts haven’t come up with any idea to solve this problem.
C. Experts think homework should be given, but not too much.
D. Experts support the idea that homework is good for students.

Friendship is one of the basic bonds between human beings. While the characteristics of friendship might vary from one country to another, people from all cultures not only enjoy friends but need them.
Many studies have shown that teenagers who have no friends often suffer from psychological disorders. It has been shown that teenagers, perhaps more than any other age group, need companionship and a sense of belonging. The negative consequences of loneliness have also been observed among the elderly. The death of a spouse often leaves a widow or a widower totally bereft. If, however, they are surrounded by friends and relatives and if they are able to express their feelings, they are more likely to recover from their grief.
“No man is an island.” In other words, we are all parts of society. We all need the love, admiration, respect and moral support of other people. If we are fortunate, our friends will provide us with all of these necessary aspects of life.
As most people observe, there are many levels of friendship. The degree or intensity of friendship varies depending on the personality of the individuals involved and the context of the relationships. Outgoing persons enjoy being surrounded by many people whereas shy persons are perhaps content with fewer but more intense friendships.
Everyone is not equally open with all their friends. The degree of closeness is determined by many factors. Close friends can be formed at any stage in one’s life but they are usually very rare. Not very many people have more than a few really close friends. Regardless of the level of closeness, all friendships are based on reciprocity (互惠), honesty and a certain amount of love and affection.
24．Who are more likely to suffer from psychological disorders without friends?
		A. Teenagers.	B. Adults.	C. The elderly.	D. A couple.
25．What does the sentence “No man is an island” really mean?
		A. No man is willing to live on an island.
		B. Man usually doesn’t go to an island
		C. Everyone is related with our society.
		D. Our society is just like an island.
26．What can we learn about outgoing people?
		A. They like being alone.
		B. They are fond of making friends.
		C. They have intense friendships.
		D. They have fewer close friends indeed
27．What does the last paragraph mainly talk about?
		A. The formation of close friends.
		B. The number of real friends.
		C. Honesty, love and affection.
		D. Factors to determine the degree of closeness.
C
A ROBOT companion for older people aims to promote activity and deal with loneliness by urging them to take part in digital and physical activities.
The ElliQ robot, made by Israel-based start-up Intuition Robotics, will be published at the Design Museum in London this week. ElliQ is a small desktop device that consists of a domed (拱形的) “body” and a separate detachable (可拆卸的) screen.
Created in collaboration with Swiss designer Yves Behar, the robot is able to encourage a degree of social engagement. Similar to home assistants like the Amazon Echo, people can simply talk to it, and there are visual clues that could be particularly helpful for those with hearing difficulties.
A key purpose of ElliQ is to act as an easy platform to access existing services such as social media, and messaging programs. For example, the device could alert the users that their grandchild has posted a new photo on Facebook, show it to them on the screen.
ElliQ can recommend activities voluntarily. It might ask if you’re interested in watching a video, for instance, or suggest a walk. It can also act as reminder to take medication.
Having a robot constantly offer suggestions could obviously get annoying, so the device uses machine learning to tailor these suggestions to individual preferences. If a suggestion is met with a positive response once, ElliQ might try it again. If not, it might change for a different tack.
28．Which of the following statements is NOT true?
		A .robot companion for older people will strongly advise them to participate in digital and 
physical activities to be healthy.
		B. The screen of the ElliQ robot can be removed if necessary.
		C. The ElliQ robot is published at the Design Museum in London.
		D. The ElliQ robot is created by Swiss designer Yves Behar and Israel-based start-up 
Intuition Robotics.

29．The underlined word “alert” is closest m meaning to       .
		A. declare	B. announce	C. say	D. remind
30．ElliQ can serve the following purposes EXCEPT       .
		A. when the user’s friend updates his moments (朋友圈), it can show it to the user on the screen.
		B. it will constantly give suggestions regardless of the user’s individual preference 
		C. it can recommend some activities even the user doesn’t ask.
		D. it can help those with hearing difficulties by offering visual clues.
31．In which column we are most likely to find the passage?
		A. News & Technology	B. People
		C. Health		D. International Affairs 

                                  D
Career criminals begin their antisocial behavior during their toddler (学步的儿童) years and may go on with a life of crime if their behavior isn’t challenged, scientists have discovered. While most children grow out of their bad behavior by adulthood, a study found those who had “callous unemotional (冷漠无情的) characteristics” could grow up to have problems with the law later in life. Behavior characteristics such as a lack of sympathy and lying in childhood could have an impact years on.
Luke Hyde, assistant professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, said, “These are signs for parents and doctors to watch out for, as they may signal more than just the terrible twos.” He said, “Parents both take care of their child and provide their child’s genes so it’s been difficult to know if we’re seeing that parenting causes callous unemotional behaviors, or if it is just a sign of the genes being passed to the child.”
The research also discovered that strict parenting is linked to the development of antisocial behavior. Scientists looked at 561 families in an adoption study that examined biological mothers’ antisocial behavior. The scientists found children of antisocial mothers were also more likely to exhibit the same behavior characteristics, despite having limited or no touch with them as they were adopted as babies.
“The really exciting take-home message from this study is that small, day-to-day positive interactions (互动) that parents have with their young children can make a huge difference in children’s development,’’ said Leslie Leve, a professor at the University of Oregon who co-led the data collection.
“Even when children have inherited (遗传) a very challenging set of behaviors, hearing ‘good job’ or receiving encouragement can help protect them from developing serious problems coming from their inherited difficulties,” he added. The study, worked on by scientists from the University of Michigan, Penn State University and the University of Oregon has been published in the American Journal of Psychiatry. Researchers will follow the group of children through early adolescence to determine if these behaviors still continue to exist from the toddler years.
32．What’s the main idea of the passage?
		A. Kids’ social behaviors are related to crime.
		B. Criminals begin their crimes during adolescence.
		C. Warmhearted kids are more likely to be criminals in the future.
		D. Antisocial behaviors of kids could be on their way to a life of crime.
33．What conclusion might the scientists draw from the study?
		A. Antisocial behaviors might be inherited.
		B. The genes decide kids’ antisocial behaviors.
		C. Antisocial behaviors have noting to do with crimes.
		D. Adopted babies surely have antisocial behaviors when they grow up.
34．What can be inferred from the passage?
		A. Parenting is the main reason that causes kids’ antisocial behaviors.
		B. What causes career criminals to begin their crimes is their parents’ characteristics.
		C. Inherited antisocial behaviors of kids can be lightened by positive parenting.
		D. Leslie Leve has a doubtful attitude to adoptive mothers’ active interactions with kids.
35．Why will researchers track kids’ process of growing?
		A. To make sure if praise will change kids.
		B. To make sure if kids’ behaviors will last.
		C. To determine if kids’ behaviors will be inherited.
		D. To determine if parents’ comfort will protect kids

		Since the day of its birth, the United Nations has been the subject of much debate.   36   
 Others think that it is too weak. We can better understand this debate if we learn more about the U.N. and its history.
		The U.N. was started for two reasons. First, when the idea was born, people all over the world were tired of war. They felt that there must be peaceful answers to the world’s problems.
   37   The second reason was that modern science had developed new bombs and airplanes.
   38   National borders were beginning to lose their meaning. Science would develop even more dangerous weapons in the future. Only an international organization would be able to control modern science.
Franklin D. Roosevelt, U.S. President at the time, believed that the Allies (联盟) should plan for peace before the war ended. On December 1, 1943, Roosevelt, Britain’s Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin from Soviet Union agreed to start an organization for world peace.   39   ．
		During the next year and a half, the idea of such an organisation was debated around the world. Then came the big day. On April 11, 1945, the first international meeting of the United Nations took place in San Francisco. The goal of the meeting was to write the U.N. Charter (宪章). All of the fifty-one nations at the meeting had their own ideas to offer for the Charter.   40   
Every nation present voted for the Charter. No one voted against it.
		A. The U.N. Charter is a beautiful piece of writing.
		B. After a long debate, a final Charter was agreed upon.
		C. They asked all countries, large and small, to join the organization.
		D. These weapons made it almost impossible for a country to defend itself.
		E. Even the smallest country on earth can have its voice heard.
		F. They also felt that only an international organization could keep world peace.
		G. Some people attack the organization because they think it is too powerful.

Whenever Michael Carl, the fashion market director at Vanity Fair, goes out to dinner with friends, he plays something called the “phone stack” game: Everyone    41   their phones in the middle of the table; whoever looks at their device before the check arrives    42   for dinner.
Brandon Holley, the former editor of Lucky magazine, had trouble    43   her mobile phone when she got home from work.

So he    46   digital devices from his bedroom—a house rule he    47   with audiences during a recent screening of Disconnect, a film that shows how technology has alienated(使疏远) people from one another.
As smart phones    48   to make their way into our lives, and wearable devices like Google Glass    49   to destroy our personal space even further, users are carving out their own device-free zones. Whether it’s a physical    50   (no ipads at the dinner table) or a conceptual one (turn off devices by 11 p.m.), users say these disconnecting    51   are improving their relationships.
“Disconnecting is something that we all    52   ,” said Lesley M. M. Blume, a New York writer who keeps her phone away from the dinner table at home. “The expectation that we must always be    53    to employers, colleagues and family creates a real problem in trying to    54   private time. But that private time is more important than ever.”
A popular method for disconnecting is to choose a box for your cellphone, like the milk tin that Ms. Holley uses. “   55    my phone is buzzing or lighting up, it’s still a distraction, so it goes in the   56   .” said Ms. Holley. Others choose new    57   . “No screens after 11 p.m.” said Ari. Melber, a TV host. “Now evenings are more   58   and I am sleeping better.” he added.
Sleep is a big factor, which is why some    59   to leave their phones out of their bedrooms. “I don’t want to sleep next to something full of photos and emails.” said Peter Som, a fashion designer, who keeps his phone charging in the living room overnight. “It   60   is a head­clearer and distinguishes daytime and sleep time.”

Mike’s mind was occupied with negative thoughts and fears concerning   63   job. When the day for the interview    64   (come), he got up late and went to the interview hurriedly, in dirty clothes and with messy hair. He was unsure of getting the job.
It so happened that Jim was competing for the job, too, but he approached the matter in a

As is often the case, when people are attending to meetings, having meals or waiting for buses, you can always find them addicting to their phones, completely ignoring others.
This is really a common phenomena in our life. The reason is why smart phones nowadays can be used for people to play mobile games and kept in touch with friends through QQ and WeChat. Therefore, too much exposure to phones are bad for people in terms of health. Moreover, people involved in phones fail to communicate well with these around them.
As far as I am concerned, people should wisely make use of their phones to help their work and study. Meanwhile, care much about their family and friends rather than mobile phones.

A
Even though you can watch a movie on your TV, laptop or iPad these days, great theatres still make going to the movies worth buying a ticket-and sometimes even worth a trip.
1. AMC Loews Uptown, Washington, D.C.
    Local movie critics will tell you “The Uptown” is the best place to see a movie in the Washington, D.C. area. Opened in 1936, it’s not a movie theatre, but a movie palace featuring a single screen—a curved（弧形的）, 70-foot long and 40-foot high screen, one of the largest in the area.
2. ArcLight Cinemas Hollywood, Los Angeles
    This Hollywood theatre isn’t just a place to see stars on screen you might catch a few sitting next to you in the audience. The theatre offers 14 screens with reserved stadium seating （the seats are wider than average）, and the famous Cinerama Dome（全景电影）.
3. Tampa Theatre, Tampa, Florida
    A classic movie palace designed by famed theatre architect John Eberson, the Tampa landmark was built in 1926. The theatre now shows both new and classic films. Come early to hear the Mighty Wurlitzer theatre organ played before most films.
4. Grauman’s Chinese Theatre, Los Angeles
    It’s not just a movie theatre. It’s a Hollywood experience. Opened in 1927, the theatre was known in its early days for lavish（奢华的）Hollywood premieres（首映）and hosting three Academy Award ceremonies. Check out the nearby Hollywood Walk of Fame before watching a movie on the big screen, and when your movie is over, stop by the next-door Kodak Theatre, where the Oscars were once held.
21. What do ArcLight Cinemas Hollywood and Grauman’s Chinese Theatre have in common?
    A. They both hosted the Oscars.          B. They were built in the same year.
    C. They offer presents to customers.       D. They are situated in the same city.
22. What can we learn about Tampa Theatre?
    A. It was opened in 1936.               B. It has a single curved screen.
    C. It has an outdoor courtyard.           D. It offers Mighty Wurlitzer play.
23. What’s the text mainly about?
    A. Famous buildings in the USA.         B. Four largest theatres in the world.
    C. Four theatres worth visiting in America.  D. Modern theatres with advanced facilities.
B
    Squatting down on my disorganized closet floor, I looked eagerly through my albums for the picture of my grandma’s Christmas lights. I searched so long and so eagerly that I lost all feeling in the legs. Ignoring the pain, I went on with my search, because finding the picture was worth it.
    My beloved grandma on my dad’s side, who passed away almost four years ago, would decorate the Christmas trees like it was her job. Each year she would decorate an ornate, 12-foot-tall, shining tree in her living room, and most years she would have an additional pink tree, palm tree, colored-light tree, white-light tree, bedroom tree, etc. The ideas varied year after year, but the theme was always the same: Let There Be Light.
    For the outside of the house, my grandma hired people to come and string thousands of lights through the trees in her yard. It wasn’t easy, and it wasn’t cheap, but it was a labor of love. People in the small town came and parked their kid-packed cars on the street, gazing at the thousands upon thousands of shining lights year after year. They brought us magic, which was grandma’s legacy. That is the family act I am supposed to follow for the rest of my life. It’s what I’m dying to recreate and pass on to my own kids. I feel so much pressure because no one is capable of doing it—and of doing it correctly—but me.
    So, it’s me and only me, each year unfastening countless strings of lights, winding them round a 10-foot, prickly tree, and sending the lights to the highest branches. Though I’m only ever just scratching the surface of grandma’s magic, I uncover a little more each year. I still haven’t found that picture of my grandma’s Christmas lights, but I know it exists, and I will find it, even if it means losing all feeling in my legs.
24. Why did the author suffer from pain?
    A. Because she was missing her beloved grandma.
    B. Because she had trouble finding grandma’s lights.
    C. Because she kept an uncomfortable gesture for long.
    D. Because she broke her legs while searching for something.  
25. What does Paragraph 2 mainly talk about?
    A. Grandma’s Christmas trees.           B. The atmosphere of Christmas.
    C. The beauty of Christmas trees.         D. Christmas memories in childhood.
26. Which of the following best describes grandma’s yard on Christmas?
    A. Colourful and messy.                B, Interesting and dizzy.
    C. Noisy and crowded.                 D. Shiny and attractive.
27.What’s the author’s attitude towards her grandma’s way to spend Christmas?  
    A. It is the best way people like.          B. It is her duty to pass it on
    C. It needs to be improved.              D. It is too costly to do it.
C
    Grasse has always been associated with smell. In the Middle Ages it smelt particularly unpleasant due to its leather tanning（制革）industry. The nobles only rarely visited the pretty and charming town to pick up their handmade leather gloves. In spite of their grand lands in the surrounding countryside, Grasse was certainly a necessary evil with no self-respecting nobles owning buildings there.
    Molinard, a Grasse tanner（制革工人）himself, created the first Grasse perfume. Word spread like wildfire amongst the nobles about the designer perfumed gloves. Molinard offered a pair of his gloves to Catherine de Medici（the Queen）, who gave plenty of praise to her Grasse perfumed gloves; she almost assured（确保）Grasse’s reputation as the perfume capital of 1he world. Thanks to Catherine de Medici, Grasse merchants were encouraged to grow the perfume plants that tanners needed to supply perfumed leather to the nobles.
    Grasse has four perfume factories as well as a perfume school and a perfume museum. Fragonard’s perfume museum is situated on the first floor of its perfume factory and displays an amazing private collection of perfume bottles, presentation boxes, documents and equipment that tells the history of perfume making from its earliest beginnings to the present day. The perfume museum is open every day, Sundays and public holidays included.
    Grasse is certainly a perfumed heaven, a far cry from its smelly beginning as a leather tanning town. Now famous for a far sweeter smell, Grasse is surrounded by fields of flowers that make real estate（不动产）in Grasse very popular,
    Those looking for real estate in France would have to go a long way to find anywhere more charming than Grasse with the city of Nice and its airport just a short drive away and plenty of activities to enjoy in the surrounding countryside. Real estate in Grasse is situated between the Southern Alps and the Cote d’Azur, allowing owners the best of both worlds.
28. Why was Grasse considered to be necessary although it was an evil?
    A. Because it produced leather gloves.
    B. Because it made the nobles look respectable.
    C. Because many nobles lived in its countryside.
    D. Because it was a beautiful and attractive town.
29. What can we learn about Fragonard’s perfume museum?
    A. It has several perfume factories.       B. It can be visited all the year round.
    C. It is famous for its perfume school.     D. It shows visitors the history of Grasse.
30. What do the underlined words “a far cry” in the 4th paragraph probably mean?           
    A. a good long cry                    B. totally absent
    C. very different                      D. far distant
31. What is the main idea of the last paragraph?
    A. Grasse is still less competitive in real estate.
    B. Grasse is now a perfect place for people to live.
    C. Grasse is becoming an important tourist attraction.
    D. Living in Grasse might cause you much inconvenience.
D
    Each day the online community reports on countless social justice issues around the world. From climate change and gun violence to natural disasters, readers come across a story, learn about an issue and often feel compelled to help. However, without any guidance on how to make a difference, many abandon the attempt and move on with their day.
    Ideal Impact, a new Web-based app（应用程序）, sees that as a lost opportunity. The app is designed to connect news stories with efficient ways to help make a difference in the real world. Let’s say, for example, you recently read an article, “The heartbreaking world of captive（被抓的）exotic birds” and felt moved by the stories of the often sad lives those birds are forced to live. Once installed on your phone or browser, Ideal Impact would show you opportunities to volunteer, donate or get involved to help captive exotic birds.
    Founder, Olivier Kamanda, explains in the company’s video, “What would happen when you
come across a story that makes you want to get involved in? That arouses a fundamental question, ‘How can I help? ’ Unfortunately there is no platform that takes you from that moment of inspiration to a meaningful service opportunity. So every year 90 million people are inspired to get involved to do something with their time and they don’t know how. And that comes at a cost of 207 billion dollars in lost volunteer time and donations.” Kamanda said in an interview with the Smithsonian, “Our app bridges the gap between people who are inspired to make a difference and organizations that need support.”
Once the app is installed as a browser plugin（插件）on a desktop or mobile device, you can read the news as you normally would. And then, when you come across a story that inspires you to take action, you can click on the Ideal Impact button that appears in the main menu of your browser. That will load the app and show you opportunities to get involved with non-profit organizations that are working to deal with the issue you just read about.
32. What is Ideal Impact?
    A. It’s software.                       B. It’s a charity group.
    C. It’s a computer company.             D. It’s a non-profit organization.
33. How does the author explain the function of Ideal Impact?
    A. By making comparisons.             B. By giving figures.
    C. By giving quotations.                D. By giving an example.
34. What can Ideal Impact do?
    A. It can help people make a contribution.
    B. It can help people search for exotic birds.
    C. It can help people read news stories more easily.
    D. It can help people make a difference to their career.
35. What will happen after you click on the Ideal Impact button?
A. You will have fun news to read.
    B. You will find a solution to a problem.
    C. You may get access to a related charity.
    D. The main menu of your browser will appear.

    We all desire to be respected, but it doesn’t come easily just by mere wishing. Outlined below are some steps you can do to get respect.
Treat others with respect. The golden rule, “Do unto others what you would like others to do unto you”, always holds true. If you cannot respect other people, do not expect them to respect you.
  36  Watch your attitude and change those ones that are hurting your relationship with others. If you notice people avoiding you or laughing at you behind your back, they are not showing you respect.   37   By doing so, you will find out which areas you need to improve to get the respect you deserve.
  38   Knowing who you are and valuing yourself as a person with a clear and fierce determination will eventually make you outstanding. People will respect individuals who believe in themselves.
    Earn the respect. If you think you can demand respect from others by force, you are wrong.   __39   Manipulating（操纵）others in order to gain respect is not only dangerous, but you are also
making a fool of yourself. Humble yourself and work hard to become a respectable person. Your efforts will be rewarded by the respect people give back to you.
    Be honest. Showing honesty in dealing with people earns their trust and eventually their respect.   40  Therefore, cultivate（培养）it the best way possible.
    A. Be confident about yourself.
    B. Evaluate your life and actions.
    C. You earn your own respect by making things happen.
    D. You harvest whatever you planted and this is a universal law.
    E. Understand that people have their own ways of looking at things.
    F. Your character is your best investment in getting people’s respect.
    G. Respect is one of the virtues that come naturally to those who work hard to win it.

If you could have one superpower, what would it be?
Dreaming about whether you would want to read minds, see through walls, or have superhuman strength may sound silly, but it actually gets to the heart of what really matters in your life.
Every day in our work, we are inspired by the people we meet doing extraordinary things to improve the world.
They have a different kind of superpower that all of us possess: the power to make a difference in the lives of others.
We’re not saying that everyone needs to contribute their lives to the poor. Your lives are busy enough doing homework, playing sports, making friends, seeking after your dreams. But we do think that you can live a more powerful life when you devote some of your time and energy to something much larger than yourself. Find an issue you are interested in and learn more. Volunteer or, if you can, contribute a little money to a cause. Whatever you do, don’t be a bystander. Get involved. You may have the opportunity to make your biggest difference when you’re older. But why not start now?
Our own experience working together on health, development, and energy the last twenty years has been one of the most rewarding parts of our lives. It has changed who we are and continues to fuel our optimism about how much the lives of the poorest people will improve in the years ahead.
24. What does the underlined part in Paragraph 2 refer to?
A. Your life style.                B. Your life value.

A. They possess different kinds of superpowers.
B. They have got the power to change the world.
C. Some people around them are making the world better.
D. There are many powerful people in their life and work.
26. What does the author stress in Paragraph 5?
A. Learning more and contributing more to a cause.
B. Rising above self and acting to help others.
C. Working hard to get a bigger opportunity.          D. Trying your best to help the poor.
27. What can be inferred from the last paragraph?
A. The author believes the lives of the poorest will get better.
B. Much more progress will be made in the near future.
C. The work on health is the most valuable experience.
D. People’s efforts have been materially rewarded.

In the depths of the French Guianese rainforest, there still remain unusual groups of indigenous(土著的) people. Surprisingly, these people live largely by their own laws and their own social customs. And yet, people in this area are in fact French citizens because it has been a colony(殖民地) of the French Republic since 1946. In theory, they should live by the French law is often ignored or unknown, thus making them into an interesting area of “lawlessness” in the world.
The lives of these people have finally been recorded thanks to the effects of a Frenchman form Paris called Gin. Gin spent five months in early 2015 exploring the most remote corners of this area, which sits on the edge of the Amazon rainforest, with half its population of only 250,000 living in its capital, Cayenne.
“I have a special love for the French Guianese people. I have worked there on and off for almost ten years,” says Gin. “I’ve been able to keep firm friendships with them. Thus I have been allowed to gain access to their living environment. I don’t see it as a lawless land. But rather I see it as an area of freedom.”
“I wanted to show the audience a photographic record touching upon the uncivilized life,” continues Gin. “I prefer to work in black and white, which allows me to show different specific worlds more clearly.”
His black-and-white pictures present a world almost lost in time. These pictures show people seemingly pushed into a world that they were unprepared for. These local citizens now have to balance their traditional self-supporting hunting lifestyle with the lifestyle offered by the modern French Republic, which brings with it not only necessary state welfare, but also alcoholism, betrayal and even suicide. 
28. Why does the author feel surprised about the indigenous people in French Guiana?
  A. They seldom follow the French law.          B. They often ignore the Guianese law.
C. They are separated from the modern world.    D. They are both Guianese and French citizens.
29. Gin introduces the special world of the indigenous Guianese as _________.
A. a tour guide      B. a geographer      C. a film director        D. a photographer
30. What is Gin’s attitude towards the lives of the indigenous Guianese?
A. Cautious.        B. Doubtful.         C. Uninterested.        D. Appreciative.
31. What does the underlined word “it” in the last paragraph refer to?
A. The modern French lifestyle.            B. The self-supporting hunting.
C. The uncivilized world.                 D. The French Republic.
D
A warm drink of milk before bed has long been the best choice for those wanting a good night’s sleep. But now a study has found it really does help people nod off—if it is milked from a cow at night.
  Researchers have discovered that “night milk” contains more melatonin(褪黑激素), which has been proven to help people feel sleepy and reduce anxiety.
  The study, by researchers from Seoul, South Korea, involved mice being fed with dried milk powder made from cows milked both during the day and at night.
  Those given night milk, which contained 10 times the amount of melatonin, were less active and less anxious than those fed with the milk collected during daytime, according to the study published in The Journal of Medicinal Food.
   Night milk quickened the start of sleep and caused the mice to sleep longer.
   While the effect of cows milk harvested at different time has not been tested on humans up to now, taking melatonin drugs has been suggested to those who are struggling to fall asleep at night.
   Previous studies have also indicated that milk can be excellent for helping sleep because of the calcium content, which helps people to relax.
  Milk is also sugar-free and additive-free with nutritionists recommending skimmed milk as the best choice before bed as it is the least fattening. The more fat you take in before bedtime, the greater burden you will put on your body at night.
32. According to the text, the mice fed with daytime milk_______.
   A. started sleep more easily                  B. were more anxious
   C. were less active                         D. woke up later
33. Which of the following is true of melatonin according to the text?
A. It’s been tested on mice for ten times.      B. It can make people more energetic.
C. It exists in milk in great amount.          D. It’s used in sleeping drugs.
34. What can be a suitable title for the text?
A. Night Milk and Sleep                  B. Fat, Sugar and Health
 C. An Experiment on Mice                D. Milk Drinking and Health
35. How does the author support the theme of the text?
    A. By giving examples.                   B. By stating arguments.

Both men and women are living longer these days in industrialized countries. 36  In general, they can expect to live six or seven years more than men. One reason for this is biological.
One important biological factor that helps women live longer is the difference in hormones between men and women.   37  Between the ages of about 12 and 50, women produce hormones that are involved in fertility(生育能力). These hormones also have a positive effect on the heart and blood flow. In fact, women are less likely to have high blood pressure or to die from heart attacks.
38   They help the body defend itself against some kinds of infections. This means that women generally ger sick less often and less seriously than men. The common cold is a good example: women, on average, get fewer colds than men.
39    Scientists are still not exactly sure how influence aging, but they believe that they do. Some think that a woman’s body cells have a tendency(向) to age more slowly than a man’s. Others think that a man’s body cells have a tendency to age more quickly. 40  
A．However, women, on average, live longer.
B .The biological factor plays an important part.
C. Women are also helped by their female genes.
D. The female hormones also protect the body in another way.
E. Recent research seems to support both of these possibilities.
F. Therefore, women are more healthy than men and can live a better life.
G. Hormones are chemicals which are produced by the body to control various body functions.

第二部分：阅读理解（共两节，满分40分）
第一节 （共15小题；每小题2分；满分30分）
A
“Joe? Is that you?” The woman speaking to me at the baseball game looked a little familiar. “Marci?” I asked. 
“It IS you !” she cried out, smiling broadly. “Gosh, it’s good to see you again !”
It was good to see Marci, too. Off and on during the past few decades, I’ve wondered about her. I almost tried to search for her a few years ago after talking to a friend who had indicated that the 1990s had been pretty rough for Marci. So meeting her at the baseball game was really out of expectation.
We spent a few minutes talking about our lives—the good old, bad old days. Then Marci grew quiet for a moment. “You know, Joe,” she said, “ I’ve always wanted to tell you…how…how sorry I am for the way I treated you. You must have been hurt both physically and mentally.” I was a little embarrassed. I turned and looked at her. “It’s OK,” I said, “No big deal!” “But I was such a jerk,” she continued. Yes you were, I thought. “We were both pretty young,” I smiled. “I know.” she said, “It’s just always bothered me, remembering how mean I was to you. And I’ve wanted to tell you that I’m sorry.”
The expression on her face was warm and sincere. And there was something in her eyes—it looked a lot like relief. “OK,” I said. “Apology accepted!” Overcome by the sweetness of the moment, I reached an arm around her and gave her a quick hug. Just then, the crowd erupted with a huge cheer, and Marci and I both returned our attention to the game. By the time I looked over to where she had been, she was gone. But the warm, wonderful feeling of our brief exchange was still there, and continues to this day whenever I think about it.
It isn’t enough to just say “I’m sorry” and “You’re forgiven.” But when those words are truly felt and sincerely expressed, they can open the door to miracles of the heart. Forgiveness can bring peace to an injured soul—even years after the fact. Even at a baseball game.
21. What kind of life did Marci live during the late 20th century according to the passage?
A. Happy.  B. Busy.   C. Hard.    D. Simple.
22. What does the underlined word “jerk” in the third paragraph mean?
A. A humorous person. B. A cruel person. C.A careless person.   D. An honest person.
23. Why did Marci look in relief after talking with the author?
A. Because her favorite team won the game.
 B. Because she learned Joe was living a good life.
C. Because she made an apology to the author.
 D. Because she found she was not mean any longer.
24. What might be the best title for the passage?
A. Excitement of a Baseball Game  	B. Mental Burden of a Woman 
C. Miracles of Forgiveness           D. Relief of Finding a friend

New research brings some good news for lovers of spicy (辛辣的) foods, after finding that eating hot red chili peppers might help to extend lifespan (寿命).
Consuming hot red chili peppers might reduce death risk, say Chopan and Littenberg from the research team. In hot peppers, such as Mexico peppers, the strong flavor comes from a compound (复合物), which does not exist in sweet peppers or onions. Studies have suggested that this compound can offer a wealth of health benefits.
A study of more than 16,000 people in the United States revealed that individuals who consumed red chili peppers had a lower risk of death from all causes over an average of 18 years than those who did not eat the spicy food. Compared with participants who did not consume hot red chili peppers, those who did were found to be at 13 percent reduced risk of all-cause death.
For example, a recent study reported by Medical News Today, found that the compound might have the potential to stop breast cancer, while an earlier study linked the compound to a reduced risk of digest system cancers. Still, the available data suggested that hot red chili pepper consumption was most strongly associated with a reduced risk of death from heart disease.
While the researchers are unable to identify the concrete compound by which red chili peppers might extend lifespan, the team says that it is likely due to the compound that is effectively against obesity (肥胖症).
Overall, the team says that these latest findings support those of the 2015 study, linking spicy food intake to reduced risk of death by showing “a significant decrease in death associated with hot red chili pepper consumption.” However, Chopan and Littenberg note that the earlier study was only conducted in Chinese adults, so the new research makes these findings more credible.
29. What can be inferred from the passage?
A. The study only goes for American people.
B. Red chili pepper can cure all-cause disease.
C. The compound protects people against obesity.D. Onion consuming can reduce death risk.
30. What is the finding of the new research mainly about?
A. Hot red chili pepper lovers develop no cancers
B. Hot red chili peppers help control breast illness.
C. Hot red chili peppers decrease heart disease. 
D. Hot red chili pepper intake may increase lifespan.
31. Which of the following has the closest meaning to the underlined word “credible”?
A. Convincing.  B. Practical.  C. Encouraging.  D. Attractive.
D
When you’re working your way through one of life’s storms, it is human nature to focus on getting back to normal, to “bounce back” as quickly as possible to a place where things are calm, familiar and comfortable.
However, actually it is unrealistic to think we can ever truly return emotionally and intelligently to where we were before the storm because every experience changes us in some way. For example, when we experience a major health scare, possibly involving some hospital time, we can never go back to being the person we were before the event even if we fully recover because we have experienced firsthand the fragility (脆弱) of life, not to mention coming face to face with death.
So, now that we can never return, what should we do?
Consider this: how is it that two people can be faced with the same hardship and while one becomes hopeless and feels anger and upset, the other is able to overcome their circumstances and grow stronger than ever as a result of the experience?
At one extreme, we may choose to accept the role of unlucky victim, or become trapped in the “Why is it always me!” negative and frustrating (令人沮丧的) situations. Either way is the result of a fixed mindset (思维模式) that is resistant to growth and change. If this is your approach to life, you will be far less likely to be active in effectively managing change and recovering from bad situations.
But there is another choice. If you are honest enough, you may consider what was once “normal” for you was just the main cause of your storm. You can choose to hug change and uncertainty and learn to grow forward through all of your experiences. Of course, this means doing the work to develop the skills and habits that will enable you to handle life’s occasional storms.
In conclusion, it is up to each of us to choose the meaning we apply to our situations at all times. Different choices will lead to different lives. Of course you can grow forward if you are determined to choose to live a positive life regardless of whatever hardships you are facing.
32. What does the author try to convey with the example in the second paragraph?
A. We will understand life much better after an escape from death.
B. It usually takes a long time to recover from a health problem.
C. It’s unlikely to return to where we were after certain events.
D. We can recover from an emotional problem much more easily.
33. When faced with hardships, some people choose to be a victim because of __________.
A. their terrible experiences   B. their negative thoughts
C. their poor health          D. their bad luck
34. What is the author’s purpose in writing the text?
A. To advise us to manage bad emotions.  B. To persuade us to get back to normal.
C. To offer us useful skills to work with.   D. To encourage us to overcome hardships.
35. If you’re determined to grow forward you have to ________.
A. experience life’s fragility     B. welcome uncertainty and change
C. develop new skills and habits  D. overcome the fear of death

If you are hungry, what do you do? Have your favorite meal and stay quiet after that? But    36    It never lets you know, because you keep it busy thinking about your friends or favorite stars. So it silently serves your needs and never lets itself grow. When mind loses its freedom to grow, creativity (创造力) gets a full stop. This might be the reason why we all sometimes think “What happens next?”, “Why can’t I think?”
       37   Why reading but not watching TV? It is because reading has been the most educative tool used by us right from childhood. Since it develops other aspects of our life, we have to take help from reading. 
    Once you read a book, you run your eyes through the lines and your mind tries to explain something to you.   38   Now this seed is unknowingly used by you to develop new ideas. If it is used many times, the same seed can give you great help to relate a lot of things, which you would have never thought of in your wildest dreams!
    This is nothing but creativity.   39   Within no time you can start talking with your friends in English or any other language and never run out of the right words.  
    So guys, do give food for your thoughts by reading, reading and more reading.   40    Go and get a book!
A. The interesting part of the book is stored in your mind as a seed. 
B. Why not do some reading while you are hungry?
C. Just like your stomach, your mind is also hungry. 
D. Now what are you waiting for?
E. Hunger of the mind can be actually solved through wide reading. 
F. Reading can help you make more friends, too. 
G. Also this makes a significant有意义的 contribution to your vocabulary.

Don’t Take the Fun Out of Youth Sports
When I joined a private football league a few years ago, the sport meant everything to me. My coach said that I had lots of potential, and I became captain of my 41 . That was before all the fun was taken out of 42 . 
At first, everyone on the team got 43 playing time. Then the team moved up to the top division after winning all its games, and the 44 started. Some parents, who had paid the coach extra so their daughters could have 45 one-on-one training, got angry when she didn’t give them more playing time in our 46 . The coach was replaced. 
The new coach, however, took all the fun out of the game: all we did during practice was 47 . I always wished to God that it would rain so we would not have the 48 . Of course, all teams run drills; they are 49 . But we ran so much that, afterwards, we had trouble 50 . Younger people shouldn’t be doing exercises 51 for 18-year-olds. 
I was very thin 52 I started football, but as a member of this team I wouldn’t eat much, because I was afraid of being too 53 to run. I feared making mistakes, and the added pressure caused me to make more than my usual 54 . 
Is all this pressure necessary? I 55 up leaving the football team. Four other girls did the same, and two of them stopped playing football completely. That’s 56 , because they had so much potential. They were just burned-out with all the pressure they 57 from the coach or their parents.

Yesterday, I went to a locally recycling center and noticed that there were several people in worn-out clothes. They appear to be homeless, at least, less lucky than me. As I walked by them with two bags that were full of empty bottle, I realized that the few dollars I would get might mean much more for them. Having decided to help me, I put my bags in front of them. Before that, I walked away without saying word. At first, they all looked confusing but their expressions quickly turned to smiles. I’m sure that my smile lasted much more longer. I believe the world will be full of love when everybody pass their own love to others.

Affordable Hearing Aid
A local board-certified Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) physician, Dt. S. Cherukuri, has shaken up the hearing aid industry with the invention of a medical-grade, affordable hearing aid. This revolutionary hearing aid is designed to help millions of people with hearing loss who cannot afford—or do not wish to pay-the much higher cost of traditional hearing aids. Dr. Cherukuri knew that untreated hearing loss could lead to depression, social isolation, anxiety, and symptoms consistent with Alzheimer’s disease. He didn’t understand why the cost for hearing aids was so high when the prices on many consumer electronics like TVs, DVD players, and cell phones had fallen. 
The high cost of hearing aids is a result of layers of middlemen and expensive unnecessary features. Dr. Cherukuri concluded that it would be possible to develop a medical grade hearing aid without sacrificing the quality of components. The result is the MDHearingAid PRO, well under $200 each when buying a pair. Order for a 45-Day Risk-Free Trial.

It’s hard not to crack a smile when you’re faced with the tail-wagging, constantly smiling Kit-Cat Clock, which is kind of the reason it first came to be. 
In the 1930s, America was in the thick of the hopeless and gloomy Great Depression, and across the country people were in low spirits. Powerless to the crisis on a larger scale, Oregon designer Earl Arnault designed a way to bring a glimmer of joy to the people around him; the Kit-Cat Clock. He conceived the feline(猫科的)—themed product in early 1932—tricky eyes, black wagging tail and all—but it wasn’t until the end of the decade when the depression began to lift that production of the clocks officially began. 
Originally, the smiling Kit-Cat Clock were made entirely from metal, but as the popularity of manufacturing with plastic grew, the Kit-Cat Clock soon followed suit. Two forepaws and a bow tie were added in the 1950s, and the wagging tail was made a little bit fashionable. Aside from these minor changes, however, the design remained largely unchanged from the time of its birth. Sadly, in the 1980s the Kit-Cat Clock nearly went kaput—with motor manufacturing relocated offshore and batteries still in their infancy(幼儿期), it was difficult to keep the clock’s many parts moving. So, it was up to the makers to come up with a solution: a brand new, powerful piece of battery technology. With the Kit-Cat Clock free to tick away another day, different colour options and sizes, and a lady version were eventually introduced, too. 
24. Why did Earl Arnault design the Kit-Cat Clock?
A. To kill the time. 
B. To bring people pleasure. 
C. To present his designing ability. 
D. To encourage people to face the crisis bravely. 
25. When was the Kit-Cat Clock put into production?
A. In the 1950s. 
B. In the 1980s. 
C. In the early 1930s. 
D. In the late 1930s. 
26. What can we infer from Paragraph Three?
A. The Kit-Cat clock is made totally from plastic now. 
B. The Kit-Cat clock has changed greatly since the 1950s. 
C. It was the new battery technology that saved the Kit-Cat Clock. 
D. Kit-Cat Clocks of different shapes can be bought on the market. 
27. What’s the passage mainly about?
A. The history of the Kit-Cat Clock. 
B. The design of the Kit-Cat Clock. 
C. The change of the Kit-Cat Clock. 
D. The purpose of the Kit-Cat Clock. 
C
I reached into the closet to unfasten the Belleek porcelain(瓷器) flower pinned to a red coat. From a navy blue jacket, I removed a dark green feather pin. I detached a sparkling diamond from the collar of a black jacket. 
Every coat and jacket of my mother was decorated with complementary jewelry. I was breaking up time-honored pairings because I had to, because she died one recent evening when she sat down to rest and never got up. So it was perfectly understandable that I put in my pocket the porcelain flower my father had sent her from boot camp when he was a young World War I Marine in Paris Island, South Carolina, but I still felt like a thief, stealing bits and pieces of my mother’s life. 
Like thieves, my sister Ellen and I were going through her private items. The treasures before me include surprises, like a lock of hair from my first haircut; my daughter’s poem to her grandmother; the notes from friends and family, including a love note to Dad in a Father’s Day card she sent him. Ah, love notes. 
I once mentioned the letters between her and my father when he served in the South Pacific. They wrote to each other daily for three years, without missing a day. “Oh, I destroyed them, ”she said as she casually poured herself a cup of tea. “How could you do that?” Tasked. My mother looked at me directly and unapologetically said, “They were not your letters but mine. They were for me alone, no one else, so I destroyed them.” Gone! Just like that! What was in them? I wondered
And yet, as I reached through her clothes, books, photos, the many possessions of a long life, I can see her point, She had a right to keep something of herself from the rest of us. Even though I wish she hadn’t, she possessed and protected her very private feelings in her own inner safe. Take everything else, she said in effect, but not those. 
28. Why did the author take away the jewellery on her mother’s clothes?
A. Because she wanted to sell them. 
B. Because her mother passed away, 
C. Because she liked them very much. 
D. Because her mother asked her to do so. 
29. What does the underlined part “time-honored pairings” in Paragraph 2 probably refer to?
A. Her mother and her father. 
B. The author and her mother. 
C. The jewellery and the letters. 
D. The jewellery and her mother’s clothes. 
30. According to the author, why did her mother destroy the letters?
A. Because her father had passed away. 
B. Because her mother thought they were useless. 
C. Because her mother wanted to keep them to herself. 
D. Because those letters were hard to recognize over time. 
31. What may be the best title for the text?
A. Mother’s love. 
B, The “Thief” in me. 
C. Destroyed letters. 
D. Mother’s jewellery.

Close your eyes, What does your dream hotel look like? Docs it have chandeliers? Do the rooms have beds covered with rose petals? Do the bathrooms have jacuzzis? Are there breathtaking views from the balcony? Is the hotel made of brick? Marble? Ice? Ice sounds a bit ridiculous, but a hotel made of ice is actually a reality. 
Sweden’s Icehotel is the latest cool hotel in town, and it really is made of ice. So, how did this idea come about? It all started in 1990. A French artist held the opening of his exhibition in a man-made igloo on the frozen Tome River- home of the Icehotel. The igloo was named “Arctic Hall” and attracted many visitors. Amongst these visitors was a brave group of adventurers who used the igloo as their accommodation. This act of bravery, (or madness, depending on your perspective)inspired the construction of the Icehotel. 
Situated 200 km above the Arctic Circle, the hotel is only open during the winter months. Why? Because the ice starts to melt in the spring time. This means that the hotel is built from scratch every year. As soon as winter begins, architects, ice sculptors and artists meet in Sweden’s Lapland to build this beautiful creation. 
But does this hotel have any of the facilities you find in a regular hotel? Well, actually, yes. In fact, the ice hotel seems to have everything: the famous “Absolute IceBar”, an ice art exhibition and a cinema. It even has an ice sauna and spa to keep you warm. And, of course, you can enjoy the natural habitat that surrounds the hotel, There is a snowmobile safari which takes you across the snowfields. And if you’re feeling brave, you can drive the snowmobile yourself. 
The Icehotel is a real find. And, it’s not impossible to get to, either. There are flights and trains every day. If you’re travelling from London, it will take you only three and a half hours to get there. So, what are you waiting for? Just make sure you wrap up warm and take a thermal sleeping bag.
32. Why did the author ask so many questions in Paragraph 1?
A, To express his doubts. 
B. To introduce the main topic. 
C. To present his dream hotel. 
D. To compare different hotels. 
33. According to the passage, “Arctic Hall” was actually used to              .
A. hold an exhibition
B. offer adventurous activities
C. store paintings and materials
D. provide accommodation for visitors
34. What is right about the Icehotel?
A. It is open all the year round. 
B. It is located outside the Arctic Circle. 
C. It is designed by Swedish artists. 
D. It takes on a new look every year. 
35. According to Paragraph 4, you can do many things in the Icehotel except              .
A. drink in the bar
B. enjoy ice sculptures
C. drive your car around
D. see a film in the cinema

Dear David, 
I’m so sorry to hear that you catch a cold on your way here. Of course I’d be happy to take you to see doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM). 
Lucky, I happen to know a doctor Mrs Yan, who is fully qualifying and has worked for nearly 30 years in the hospital near my house, She has such much experience that she has a very good knowledge of herbal medicine. I plan to take you directly to visit her. I’m sure she’ll be able to help yourself. 
TCM doctors don’t treat for everyone in the same way. Moreover, TCM can not only produce effective cures and have few side effect. 
Seeing you on Monday. I hope you will get well soon.

Dear Mr Steven, 
I’m going to study in your school as an exchange student. I’m a little bit anxious on account of it being my first time to go abroad, so I’m writing to seek help from you so I can learn more about my stay there. 
What I’m most concerned about is the course arrangement. Knowing more about them well in advance could help me prepare well for my study. W hen it comes to accommodation, I want to know about the details, such as the size of the dormitory and the number of students per room. Additionally, I would like to know if there is anything else I should pay more attention to and prepare. 
I would appreciate it if you could give me a reply at your earliest convenience. 
Yours faithfully,

A typical lion tamer（驯兽师）in people’s mind is an entertainer holding a whip( 鞭) at a chair. The whip gets all of the attention, but it’s mostly for show. In reality, it’ the chair that does the important work. When a lion tamer holds a chair n front of the lion’s face, the lion tries to focus on all four legs of the chair at the same time. With its focus divided, the lion becomes confused and is unsure about what to do next. When faced with so many options, the lion chooses to freeze and wait instead of attacking the man holding the chair.
How often do you find yourself in the same position as the lion? How often do you have something you want to achieve (e.g. lose weight., start a business, travel more)—only to end up confused by all of the options in front of you and never make progress?
This upsets me to no end because while all the experts are busy debating about which option is been the people who want to improve their lives are left confused by all of the conflicting information. The end result is that we feel like we cant’ focus or that we’re focused on the wrong things, and so we take less action, make less progress, and stay the same when we could be improving.
It doesn’t have to be that way. Anytime you find the world waving a chair in your face, remember this: All you need to do is focus on one thing,. You just need to get started. Starting before you feel ready is one of the habits of successful people. If you have somewhere you want to go, something you want to accomplish, someone you want to become…take immediate action. If you’re clear about where you want to go, the rest of the world will either help you get there or get out of the way.
24. Why does the lion tamer use a chair? 
A. To trick the lion.            B. To show off his skills.
C. To get ready for a fight.      D. To entertain  the audience.
25．In what sense are people similar to a lion facing a chair?
A. They feel puzzled over choices.      B. They hold on to the wrong things.
C. They find it hard to make changes.    D. They have to do something for show
26. What is the author’s attitude towards the expert mentioned in Paragraph3?
A. Tolerant.                  B. Doubtful.  
C. Respectful.                D. Supportive.
27. When the world is “ waving a chair in your face”, you’re advised to _____
A. wait for a better chance   B. break your old habits
C. make a quick decision    D. ask for clear guidance
C
If you are a fruit grower—or would like to become one—take advantage of Apple Day to see what’s around. It’s called Apple Day but in practice it’s more like Apple Month. The day itself is on October 21, but since it has caught on, events now spread out over most of October around Britain.
Visiting an apple event is a good chance to see, and often taste, a wide variety of apples. To people who are used to the limited choice of apples such as Golden Delicious and Royal Gala in supermarkets, it can be quite an eye opener to see the range of classical apples still in existence, such as Decio which was grown by the Romans. Although it doesn’t taste of anything special, it’s still worth a try, as is the knobbly(多疙瘩的) Cat’s Head which is more of a curiosity than anything else.
There are also varieties developed to suit specific local conditions. One of the very best varieties for eating quality is Orleans Reinette, but you’ll need a warm, sheltered place with perfect soil to grow it, so it’s a pipe dream for most apple lovers who fall for it.
At the events, you can meet expert growers and discuss which ones will best suit your conditions, and because these are family affairs, children are well catered for with apple-themed fun and games.
Apple Days are being held at all sorts of places with an interest in fruit, including stately gardens and commercial orchards(果园).If you want to have a real orchard experience, try visiting the National Fruit Collection at Brogdale, near Faversham in Kent.
28.What can people do at the apple events?
   A. Attend experts’ lectures.       B. Visit fruit-loving families.
   C. Plant fruit trees in an orchard.   D. Taste many kinds of apples.
29.What can we learn about Decio?
A. It is a new variety.                B. It has a strange look.  
C. It is rarely seen now.              D. It has a special taste.
30. What does the underlined phrase “a pipe dream” in Paragraph 3mean?
   A. A practical idea.     B. A vain hope.        C.A brilliant plan.   D. A selfish desire.
31.What is the author’s purpose in writing the text?
A. To show how to grow apples.         B .To introduce an apple festival.
C. To help people select apples.         D. To promote apple research.
                         D
More students than ever before are taking a gap year (间隔年) before going to university. It used to be called the “year off” between school and university. The gap-year phenomenon originated (起源) with the months left over to Oxbridge applicants between entrance exams in November and the start of the next academic year.
   This year, 25,310 students who have accepted places in higher education institutions have put off their entry until next year, according to statistics on university entrance provided by the University and College Admissions Service (UCAS). That is a record 14.7% increase in the number of students taking a gap year. Tony Higgins from UCAS said that the statistics are good news for everyone in higher education, “Students who take a well-planned year out are more likely to be satisfied with, and complete, their chosen course. Students who take a gap year are often more mature and responsible,” he said.
   But not everyone is happy. Owain James, the presidents of National Union of Students(NUS), argued that the increase is evidence of student hardship -- young people are being forced into earning money before finishing their education. “students are now aware that they are likely to leave university up to $15,000 in debt. It is not surprising that more and more students are taking a gap year to earn money to support their study for the degree. NUS statistics show that over 40% of students are forced to work during term time and the figure increases to 90% during vacation periods,” he said.
32. What do we learn about the gap year from the text?
   A. It is flexible in length.           B. It is a time for relaxation.
   C. It is increasingly popular.         D. It is required by universities
33. According to Tony Higgins, students taking a gap year _____.
   A. are better prepared for college studies         B. know a lot more about their future jobs
   C. are more likely to leave university in debt      D. have a better chance to enter top universities
34. How does Owain feel about the gap-year phenomenon?
    A. He’s puzzled.     B. He’s worried.      C. He’s surprised.    D. He’s annoyed.
35. What would most students do on their vacation according to NUS statistics?
  A. Attend additional courses     B. Make plans for the new term
  C. Earn money for their education D. Prepare for their graduate studies

Good Morning Britain’s Susanna Reid is used to grilling guests on the sofa every morning, but she is cooking up a storm in her latest role — showing families how to prepare delicious and nutritious meals on a tight budget.

Everybody can buy takeaway food, but sometimes we’re not aware how cheaply we can make this food ourselves. "

Languages have been coming and going for thousands of years, but in recent times there has been less coming and a lot more going. When the the world was still populated by hunter-gatherers,small, tightly knit (联系)groups developed their own patterns of speech independent of each other.Some language experts believe that 10,000 years ago, when the world had just five to ten million people, they spoke perhaps 12,000 languages between them.
Soon afterwards, many of those people started settling down to become farmers, and their languages too became more settled and fewer in number. In recent centres, trade,industrialisation. the development of the nation-state and the spread of universal compulsory education. Especially glbalisation and better communications in the past few decades,all have caused many Languages to disappear,and dominant languages such as English．Spanish and Chinese are increasingly taking over.
At present, the world has about 6 800 languages. The distribution of these languages is hugely uneven. The general rule is that mild zones have relatively few languages. Often spoken by many people while hot. wet zones have lots, often spoken by small numbers.Europe has only around 200 Languages: the Americas about 1,000. Africa 2 400; and Asia and the Pacific perhaps 3,200, of which Papua New Guinea alone accounts for well over 800. The median number (中位数)of speakers is a mere 6.000, which means that half the worlds languages are spoken by fewer people than that.
Already well over 400 of the total of, 6,800 languages are close to extinction(消亡), with only a few elderly speakers left. Pick, at random, Busuu in Cameroon (eight remaining speakers),Chiapaneco in Mexico(150). Lipan Apache in the United States(two or three)or Wadjigu in Australia (one, with a question-mark): none of these seems to have much chance of survival.
28. What can we infer about languages in huntergatherer times? 
A.They developed very fast.    B. They were large in number.
C. They had similar patters.    D. They were closely connected
29. Which of the following best explains"dominant " underlined in paragraph 2？
A.Complex.    B. Advanced.
C.Powerful.    D.Modem.
30. How many languages are spoken by less than 6, 000 people at present?  
A.About 6 800   B.About 3 400
C.About 2.400   D.About 1-200
31. What is the min idea of the text? 
A. New languages will be created.
B Peoples lifestyles are reflected in languages
C. Human development results in fewer languages
D. Geography determines language evolution.

We may think we're a culture that gets rid of our worn technology at the first sight of something shiny and new, but a new study shows that we keep using our old devices(装置) well after they go out of style. That’s bad news for the environment — and our wallets — as these outdated devices consume much more energy than the newer ones that do the same things.
To figure out how much power these devices are using, Callie Babbitt and her colleagues at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York tracked the environmental costs for each product throughout its life — from when its minerals are mined to when we stop using the device. This method provided a readout for how home energy use has evolved since the early 1990s. Devices were grouped by generation — Desktop computers, basic mobile phones, and box-set TVs defined 1992. Digital cameras arrived on the scene in 1997. And MP3 players, smart phones, and LCD TVs entered homes in 2002, before tablets and e-readers showed up in 2007.
As we accumulated more devices, however, we didn't throw out our old ones. "The living-room television is replaced and gets planted in the kids' room, and suddenly one day, you have a TV in every room of the house," said one researcher. The average number of electronic devices rose from four per household in 1992 to 13 in 2007. We're not just keeping these old devices — we continue to use them. According to the analysis of Babbitt's team, old desktop monitors and box TVs with cathode ray tubes are the worst devices with their energy consumption and contribution to greenhouse gas emissions（排放）more than doubling during the 1992 to 2007 window.
So what's the solution（解决方案）? The team's data only went up to 2007, but the researchers also explored what would happen if consumers replaced old products with new electronics that serve more than one function, such as a tablet for word processing and TV viewing. They found that more on-demand entertainment viewing on tablets instead of TVs and desktop computers could cut energy consumption by 44%.
32. What does the author think of new devices?
A. They are environment-friendly.						B. They are no better than the old.
C. They cost more to use at home.						D. They go out of style quickly.
33. Why did Babbitt's team conduct the research?
A. To reduce the cost of minerals.
B. To test the life cycle of a product.
C. To update consumers on new technology.
D. To find out electricity consumption of the devices.
34. Which of the following uses the least energy?
A. The box-set TV.									B. The tablet.
C. The LCD TV.										D. The desktop computer.
35. What does the text suggest people do about old electronic devices?
A. Stop using them.									B. Take them apart.
C. Upgrade them.									D. Recycle them.

They’re the little spots of color like throw pillows ,mirrors and baskets that most of us use to add visual interest to our rooms .Less tiring than painting your walls and less expensive than buying a colorful sofa ,small color choices bring with them the significant benefit of being easily changeable .

The large color decisions in your rooms concern the walls, ceilings, and floors .Whether you’re looking at wallpaper or paint, the time, effort and relative expense put into it are significant.   40   .
A. While all of them are useful 
B. Whatever you’re looking for 
C. If you’re experimenting with a color 
D. Small color choices are the ones we’re most familiar with 
E. It’s not really a good idea to use too many small color pieces

Culture shock is a complex topic, but I'm a simple man with simple perspectives. So my experience of foreign culture boils down to three basic stages: anger, acceptance and appreciation. 
When I began my life in China I was often filled with frustration and    1   over the way things were. Things were seen as clearly “  2    ” and I rejected the view of there being other ways of doing things. Afterwards I came to   3   different ways of doing things but still saw my own ways as superior.
My views were still heavily colored by   4     and I often accepted situations I felt   5   by simply coining the phrase "That's China,"    6    China was a backward country that simply didn't do things correctly. Finally, however , I came to understand and appreciate the new   7     and ways of doing things, sometimes using them as effectively as the     8   .
For example, fish is never    9     with the head in my country, thus my feelings went from “Ugh! I can’t eat this! The fish is    10    at me saying, `You're a   11   man.' Take this off the table,” to “I’ll let my friends enjoy, but I'll just stick with the other dishes,” and to "Would anyone mind if I eat the eyeball?"
It is not the same with every westerner, and some take    12    than others to go through the three stages. It all depends on how   13    you are and how tightly you   14   to your own culture. It took a little over a year of living in China before I finally appreciate the new culture. Now, I'm more    15    in China than in my own country.

You don't seem your usual cheery self?” IF looked at WHEN and replied, “I just don't feel I am making any progress. Last week I saw a course and wanted to take if only I had the time to take it.” WHEN knew exactly how IF felt. “I too saw a course and I am going to register when I get enough money.” said WHEN, “What about that new job you were going to apply for? You were so excited about it last week.” IF responded, “If my computer didn't break down last week, I would have applied. So I could not type my resume.”
“Don't worry about it.When you are ready another job will come through. I have been thinking about looking for another job too, but I will wait and when the weather gets nicer I will look then.” WHEN then went on to tell IF about his week, hoping that it would cheer him up a bit. 
The man at the next table couldn't help overhearing WHEN and IF. “Excuse me gentlemen,” the man said. Surprised, IF and WHEN both looked at the man. The man continued, “I'm sorry, but I couldn't help hearing your conversation. I think I know how you could solve your problems.” Curious, IF asked the gentleman, “How do you think you can solve our problems?” The gentleman smiled and said, “You only need to listen to yourselves. It reminds me of an old proverb: 'If and When were planted, and Nothing grew'.” The gentleman went on, “Just start doing, take action, and stop talking about 'if and when'.” IF and WHEN suddenly realized that what the gentleman had said was so true. Both of them were guilty of thinking and living their life for the "ifs and whens". The gentleman left and their conversation changed. They made up their mind that when they met for lunch next week, there would be no "ifs and whens"; they would only talk about what they accomplished! Soon another week came.

A. he failed to arrange time for a course     B. he missed a course for lack of money

CHICAGO(Reuters)-Smoking not only can wrinkle the face and turn it yellow—it can do the same to the whole body, researchers reported on Monday．
The study，published in the Archives of Dermatology，shows that smoking affects the skin all over the body-even skin protected from the sun．.
“We examined non-facial skin that was protected from the sun，and found that the total number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day and the total．years a person has smoked were linked with the amount of skin damage a person experienced，” Dr．Yolanda Helfrich of the University of Michigan，who led the study，said in a statement．
“In participants older than 65 years，smokers had significantly more fine wrinkling than nonsmokers. Similar findings were seen in participants aged 45 to 65 years.” Helfrich's team added in their report．
The researchers tested 82 people，smokers and nonsmokers, taking pictures of the inner right arms．They ranged，in age from 22 to 91 and half were smokers．Independent judges decided how wrinkled each person's skin was．
When skin is exposed to sunlight，notably the face，it becomes coarse(粗糙的)．Wrinkled and discolored with a pale yellow tint，Helfrich's team wrote．
Several previous studies have found that cigarette smoking conduces to premature(过早的)skin aging as measured by facial wrinkles，the study said，but little has been done to measure the aging of skin not exposed to light．
The report did not discuss die mechanism involved but previous research has found that cigarette smoke，among other things，causes blood vessels(血管)beneath the skin to constrict (紧缩)，reducing blood supply to the skin．
Smoking can also damage the connective tissue that supports both die skin and the internal organs．
31. When your skin is exposed to sunlight long，it becomes all of the following Except  ________.
A. discolored      B. coarse           C. rough          D. flexible
32. What does the underlined phrase “conduces to” in Paragraph 7 mean?
A. help           B. encourage        C. prevent         D. stop
33. How wrinkled a person's skin is doesn't relate to       .
A. the number of cigarettes a person smokes      B. the kind and characteristics of skin
C. how long a person smokes                  D. how long skin is under sunlight
34. From the passage smoking results in skin aging mainly because       .
A. it can make skin come off                   B. it can make you feel tired
C. it will lower blood supply to skin             D. it can make blood run faster
35. The main purpose of the passage is to        .
A. inform people about the result of the study   B. advise people how to protect skin
C. warn people not to smoke again           D. introduce a new way of avoid skin aging

Every profession or trade, every art, and every science has its technical vocabulary, the function of which is partly to refer to things or processes which have no names in ordinary English, and partly to secure greater exactness in expression. Such special dialects, or jargon, are necessary in technical discussion of any kind. Being universally understood by the devotees of the particular science or art, they have the precision of a mathematical formula(公式). Besides, they save time, for it is much more economical to name a process than to describe it. Thousands of these technical terms are very properly included in every large dictionary, yet, as a whole, they are rather on the outskirts of the English language than actually within its borders.
Different professions, however, differ widely in the character of their special vocabularies. In trades and handicrafts and other professions, such as farming and fishing, that have occupied great numbers of men from remote times, the technical vocabulary is very old. It consists largely of native words, or of borrowed words that have worked themselves into the very fiber of our language, hence, though highly technical in many particulars, these vocabularies are more familiar in sound, and more generally understood than most other technicalities. The special dialects of law, medicine, and philosophy have also become pretty familiar to cultivated person, and have contributed much to the popular vocabulary.
Yet, every profession still possesses a large body of technical terms that remain essentially foreign, even to educated speech. And the proportion has been much increased in the last fifty years, particularly in the various departments of natural and political sciences and in the mechanic arts. So new terms are coined with the greatest freedom, and abandoned with indifference when they have served their turn. Most of the new coinages（创新词语）are restricted to special discussions and seldom get into general literature or conversation. Yet no profession is nowadays, as all profession once were, a closed guild (行会). The lawyer, the physician, the man of science, and the cleric (神职人员) associate freely with his fellow creatures, and do not meet them in a merely professional way.
Furthermore, what is called popular science makes everybody acquainted with modern views and recent discoveries. Any important experiment, though made in a remote laboratory, is at once reported in the newspapers, and everybody is soon talking about it—as in the case of the Roentgen rays and wireless telegraphy. Thus, our common speech is always taking up new technical terms and making them commonplace(常见的事). .
36. What is the passage mainly about?
A. Technical terms’ characters in different occupations.  
B. Technical terms’s popularity in different cultures .
C. Technical vocabulary’ development.
D. Technical vocabulary’s functions.
37. What does the underlined sentence in Para. 1 mean?
A. Technical terms are usually used in the urban areas.
B. Technical terms are always used in the rural areas.
C. Technical terms don’t constitute the core of common speech.
D. Technical terms are not understood by English farmers.
38. From the passage, we can learn that______.
A. it is easier to become a professional today than it was in the past
B. there is more social communication between professionals and others
C. popular science has told its secrets to people all over the world
D. no one can understand more things in profession now than ever
39. It can be concluded from the last paragraph that _____.
A. the English language is becoming increasingly expanded
B. the words of the English language are always changing now
C. one can never be sure what a word means without consulting an expert
D. technical terms have little chance of being the main body of the language
40. The author mentions Roentgen rays and wireless telegraphy as examples of ________.
A. rapid occurrence of jargon   		       B. quick talk of an experiment
C. precision of jargon in meaning  	           D. fast expansion of technical words

With the Tesla Roadster and other plug­in (插入式) electric vehicles hitting the road，demand is growing for accessible refueling points to recharge them. Carbon Day Automotive，a Chicago­based company，has now demonstrated a solar­powered recharging point，known as the Solar Plug­In Station，which lets motorists easily charge their cars using electricity that has been produced without any environmental damage.
The Solar Plug­In Station has gone on show in Chicago as part of the city’s bid to host the 2016 Olympic Games. According to Carbon Day Automotive，the Solar Plug­In Station on show in Chicago is part of the vital infrastructure(基础设施) required for electric vehicles in Chicago and was the focus of a recent visit by the International Olympic Committee.
These solar­powered electricity points will be used daily to fuel the city’s electric vehicles with power from the sun. By producing the electricity from pollution­free solar cell，the CO2 emissions are reduced to zero.
“Solar energy and electric vehicles are a partnership that is one more step to reducing our dependence on foreign oil,” says Richard Lowenthal, CEO of Coulomb Technologies.Coulomb Technologies recently developed the components (部件) required for individual recharging stations，marketed as ChargePoint Networked Charging Stations.Carbon Day Automotive is the Midwest distributor for the ChargePoint stations. .
The Solar Plug­In Station consists of giant solar panels (电池板) that shade the tiny ChargePoint Networked Charging Station.The solar panel is connected to an underground battery pack，ready for everyday refueling.
“Without these stations it would be like driving around in a traditional car without the availability of gas stations，” says Scott Emalfarb，CEO at Carbon Day.“The day of true plug­in electric vehicles will be here sooner than most people realize and the world needs to be ready to accommodate them.”
41. The Solar Plug­In Station is used as part of the bid to host the Olympics mainly because ________.
A. it’s environmentally friendly				     
B. it makes up for the lack of electricity
C. it’s a new idea and attracts people’s attention	 
D. it brings convenience to electric vehicle users

42. We can learn from the passage that ________.
A. to recharge the electric vehicles takes a long time	
B. the Solar Plug­In Station will come into use in 2016
C. the Solar Plug­In Station has gone on show internationally	
D. Chicago is promoting the use of electric vehicles
43. According to the passage，how many of the following statements are TRUE?
a. Tesla Roadster is a kind of plug­in electric vehicle.
b. The Solar Plug­In Station uses solar power to charge all of the cars.
c. Chicago is a city，which is rich in oil.
d. The Solar Plug­In Station consists of underground battery packs.
e. Scott Emalfarb is optimistic about the future of plug­in electric vehicles.
A．2.         B．3.            C．4.               D．5.
44. The passage implies that when the Solar Plug­In Station becomes popular，________.
A. more visitors will come to Chicago				
B. the citizens of Chicago will be able to go to work faster
C. more space for electric vehicles will be needed
D. the cost of electric vehicles will be lower than traditional cars
45. What would be the best title for the passage?
A. Chicago Will Soon Be Full of Electric Vehicles		
B. Chicago Calls on People to Buy Electric Vehicles
C. Chicago Fights for Its Bid to Host the 2016 Olympics	
D. Chicago Shows Its Solar­powered Recharging Stations

Billy, a high school boy, is 17 years old. He has a part-time job in his vacations which gets him up every morning at 5 o'clock. He is a newspaper delivery boy.
It is still dark when he gets up, but during the rest of the year it is light. Bill must deliver the newspapers to the houses of the people on his route in all kinds of weather. He tries to put each paper on the porch where it will be protected from wind and rain of snow. All his customers think he does a good job. Billy earns about $ 70 per month, and he is earning some of the money to go to college. He spends the rest on records and clothes. Once a month, he has to collect money from his customers. Since many of them work during the day, Billy has to collect the money in the evening. Sometimes, when Billy is ill, his brother has to deliver the newspapers. Once, his father has to help. Billy has 70 customers now, but he hopes to get more soon. Some day, if he gets more customers, Billy might win a prize for being an outstanding newspaper boy. He wants to win a trip to Europe, but he will still be happy if he only wins a new bicycle.

Dear Mom and Dad,
The annual College Entrance Examination is around the corner. On this special occasion, how I wish I could have a heart-to-heart talk with you.
Firstly, I would like to show my appreciation to you for giving me my life and bringing me up with great care and love. I’ve always been grateful to you for sharing my happiness of success and giving me constant encouragement when I’m in low spirits through those years of my growing up. I’m glad to tell you that I’ve been working really hard recently, thus making remarkable progress in my studies, but what is disturbing me is my anxiety before each important exam. With the College Entrance Examination drawing near, I am under great pressure, so your frequent communication and timely support can surely help me keep a good state. Finally, I want to share with you some of my plans for the coming vacation, such as going out for journey, helping with more of your housework and enjoying the 2012 London Olympic Games which I’ve been expecting.   
I am quite confident of my future life and I do wish you good health and a happy life.

Possible version: 
Billy，a high school student, takes a part time job as a newspaper delivering boy. In hopes of earning money to go to college and winning a prize, he works hard and does so good a job that all of his customers think highly of him. .
Nowadays there is a growing tendency that more and more high school graduates have part-time jobs after graduation. Some work as shop assistants or waiters. Some distribute handbills on the street and some act as private tutors. 
Students can get great benefit from taking part-time jobs in vacations. Several reasons can account for this. First，taking a part time job, to some extent, can help to solve the financial problem for those coming from poor families. Second，such jobs provide students with good opportunities to enrich their social experience and broaden their horizons, which will do good to them in their future study and life. Last, the jobs make it possible for students to put what they have learned in class into practice. 
After graduation, I tend to have a part-time job as a private tutor for pupils. 
For one thing, I can enjoy staying with children. For another, it feels good to help children make progress in their study through my efforts.

On Christmas Eve, 1944, my grandmother urged my uncle, then 12 years old, to slip out of the concentration camp（集中营） where they were imprisoned near 15 miles east of Vienna to go to Deutsch-Wagram. “People are kind around Christmas,” Grandma Lili said to her son, Gyuri. “Ask for some food. Anything they can spare. Tell them that we’re on the edge of starvation. Tell them that your 3-year-old sister can not get off the bed because she’s outgrown her shoes.”
In the dark of that night, Gyuri secretly left the camp and walked nearly four miles to Deutsch-Wagram, the closest town. He happened upon a house and knocked on the front door. A woman opened that door. She was probably alone, her man far away, fighting in the war, her children asleep in their beds. The 12-year-old pieced together in German exactly what his mother had told him to say.
“Come back tomorrow," whispered the woman. The next day, my uncle returned. The woman opened the door with a smile. She piled his hands with bread, clothing, a pair of shoes that her child had outgrown and a pair of socks. The woman had knitted warm socks for my mother. After putting on the socks and shoes that fit, my mother got off the bed in delight. Her ragged shoes were passed on to a younger child who was also living in the camp. They shared their unexpected harvest with the entire camp. It was a quiet celebration of human kindness around Christmas.
In April 1945, my mother, uncle and grandmother were liberated（解放）. And it was those very socks and shoes that my mother wore as she walked some 28 miles over two days to Bratislava on her walk to a new life.
To the unknown giver, I thank you. In the desperation of a cold and snowy land, when many hearts were closed and death was more likely than life, especially for Jews, you gave them hope and comfort.
24. What did Gyuri manage to do on Christmas Eve?
	A. Get permitted to go out.	B. Receive food and clothing.
	C. Express what his family needed.	D. Celebrate Christmas in the camp.
25. How did the author’s mother feel when she got off the bed?
	A. Desperate.	B. Happy.	C. Honored.	D. Hopeful.
26. What can we infer about Gyuri?
	A. He lacked courage.	
	B. He was strong in body and mind.	
	C. He helped the woman with food and clothes.					
	D. He liberated the whole camp.
27. What is the passage mainly about?
	A. Light in darkness.		B. Peace to common people.
	C. Courage in face of danger.	D. The influence of Christmas.

I was in a taxi in Singapore last week and I couldn't help but notice the sticker attached to the back of the driver’s seat. In English and Chinese it read, “We accept Alipay.” It was a reminder that e-commerce in China is no longer just about how great brands break into the Chinese market. It’s also about an important part of China’s economy coming to you.
If you are a brand manager or a salesman, you’re increasingly likely to find yourself fighting with the push of Chinese e-commerce companies in your home market. That’s for two reasons: China’s leadership in electronic payments and the continued rise in Chinese tourism. The result of this is that Chinese consumers are an increasingly important factor in markets around the world.
On the electronic payment front, there are some strong reasons to introduce the electronic payment systems Chinese consumers are already using. In China, the traditional wallet has been replaced by an electronic wallet on a smartphone. It’s common to make all of your payments for daily needs through that smartphone, using one of the two main electronic payment providers: WeChat Pay or Alipay.
It’s not just easy to use. These two tech companies have the influence and customer base to push their payment systems beyond their original e-commerce area. Noodle shops will take electronic payments, and even street musicians have QR(二维码) for donations. Whether you are paying your electricity bill or seeing a doctor, your mobile phone can handle the payment.
As a result, China is today the most cash-free of any of the world’s major economies — and that trend will continue. Already, the numbers are staggering. According to a survey by Ipsos and Tencent, 14% of Chinese people do not carry any cash, while 26% hold less than RMB100 (less than $16) in their wallets, day to day. According to consulting firm iResearch, in 2016 China’s mobile payments hit $5.5 trillion, almost 50 times America’s $112 billion.
28.What is the writer’s purpose of telling his experience in a taxi in Singapore?
	A. To introduce the topic of the text.	B. To examine a problem in detail.
	C. To offer some solutions to an issue.	D. To inform the finding of a new study.
29. What does the fact that Alipay is accepted overseas indicate? 
	A. Mobile payment in China is becoming more and more popular.
	B. Chinese economy is taking up a bigger share internationally.
	C. Great brands find it harder to enter the Chinese market.
	D. The world market is determined by Chinese tourists.
30. What is the author’s attitude towards China’s e-commerce?
	A. Doubtful.	B. Positive.	C. Disapproving.	D. Uncaring.
31. Which can best replace the underlined word “staggering” in the last paragraph?
	A. Proper.	B. Important.	C. Popular.	D. Impressive.

D
Many people wrongly think that cities don’t have farms and that fruits and vegetables are only grown in the country. Believe it or not, there are more and more urban farms popping up in cities all over the world.
Alexandra Sullivan, a food system researcher in New York City, studies urban agriculture. Urban agriculture is another name for farming and gardening in a city environment. Ms. Sullivan studies everything from tiny gardens in empty lots between buildings to bigger fields that have been planted and grown. According to Ms. Sullivan, “Urban agriculture has existed since cities have, across the world.”
The number of humans living in urban areas, or cities, is increasing. The amount of people who want to garden in urban areas is also rising. Ms. Sullivan says, “In small gardens, on rooftops and indoors, they grow fruits, vegetables, grains, and herbs, and raise animals to produce milk, eggs, honey, and meat. They use these foods as supplements（补充） to food produced by rural agriculture.” Even though some people who live in urban areas grow crops, urban residents still need to rely on food grown in rural areas. This is because a city doesn’t have enough space to grow enough food for everyone living in it.
In New York City, urban farmers have come up with many different ways to grow their own produce, even though there isn’t a lot of room. For example, Brooklyn Grange is a farming operation that has two rooftop vegetable farms in New York City. All together, the farms are made up of 2.5 acres of rooftop space. This makes Brooklyn Grange one of the largest rooftop farming operations in the world.
Brooklyn Grange grows all kinds of things. The farming company sells its vegetables to local residents and restaurants. And because the farms are on rooftops, they are specially adapted to their urban location. They use available space that is not needed for anything else. As more urban farmers find ways to grow food in cities, urban residents will be better able to get fresher materials for their meals.
32. Which of the following is Ms. Sullivan’s opinion according to the text? 
	A. Urban agriculture is disappearing all over the world.
	B. Urban agriculture is another name for farming.
	C. Urban agriculture has a history as long as cities.
	D. Foods are only grown in tiny gardens in cities.
33. Why do people in the cities still rely on foods grown in the rural areas according to Paragraph 3?
	A. The foods grown in rural areas are supplements to the foods grown in urban areas.    
	B. There is not enough space to grow enough food for everyone in the cities.
	C. The number of people wanting to grow food in urban areas is increasing.    
	D. People need different kinds of food.
34. What can we learn about Brooklyn Grange in New York City from the text?
	A. It provides most of the foods in cities.
	B. It can only grow single products.
	C. It is the only largest farming operation in the world.
	D. It makes use of rooftop space to grow vegetables.
35. What may be the best title for the text?
	A. Farms in Cities.		B. Future Food System.
	C. Food Grown in Cities.	D. Agriculture of New York City.

When you were in high school, everyone wanted to know where you were going to go to college.   36   If you don’t know how to choose your major, try asking yourself these four questions.

What life factors(因素) do I need to consider?
Additional factors may influence your college choices: family, finance, cultural expectations. While exploring your own path is highly important, it’s also important to keep in mind that these forces will have an influence on your post-college life in one way or another.    40   Try to make the situation more manageable. 
    A. What do I love?
    B. What skills do I want to learn?
    C. Do you always earn praise for your art work? 
    D. Spend your freshman year researching subjects that interest you.
    E. Your major and your preparation for a profession don’t have to be the same.

【解析】本文是一篇记叙文。文章主要记叙了作者本人学会用筷子的点点滴滴。
61. 考查动名词。在when it comes to …这一固定句型中，to是介词，后接名词或动名词。句意：说到拿筷子，我不会称自己为最有成就的人。故填holding。
62. 考查动词。根据上下文可知，这里是指“握住我的筷子”。句意：我往往握住筷子的中间。故填mine。
63. 考查名词。固定短语come to a conclusion得出结论，故用名词形式。句意：得出了一个简单的结论。故填conclusion。
64. 考查情态动词。本题考查情态动词must表推测的用法，因为是对过去行为的推测，故用have done。句意：一定会向我展示怎么用它们。故填have shown。
65. 考查介词。短语introduce sb. to sth.向某人介绍某物。句意：并向我介绍许多新菜。故填to。
66. 考查非谓语动词。这里为过去分词作定语，意思为“为中国人所偏爱的”。句意：以及中国人所偏爱的器皿。故填preferred。
67. 考查名词。根据前面的our和后面的forks and spoons,可知，这里用其复数形式。句意：一起的还有刀叉和调羹。故填knives。
68. 考查强调句。因为被强调部分是人，所以，既可以用who也可以用that。句意：是我最亲密的家人看到我第一次错误的使用筷子。故填who/that。
69. 考查时态和语态。根据全文时态及句意可知，主语I与expect为动宾关系，故用过去时的被动形式。句意：人们预计我在几乎每一个餐馆、摊点和酒吧都会使用筷子。故用was expected。
70. 考查冠词。这里meal为可数名词，单数，非特指。句意：用这些器皿咽下一顿饭。故填a。

The first week of my summer campaign has been quite an experience! I'm learning the ups and downs of guiding this new journey,and I'm soon finding my footing in the wonderful world of support raising.
Some may ask: Why do you choose a job where support raising is necessary? Why not just find a ministry that will support you without having to do any extra work?
I had a wonderful support meeting this week where I was able to have some very good conversations with the lady I was sharing with.It blessed my soul to see her eyes light up with the same passion（热情）I felt in my heart about the ministry I was sharing with her.I kept thinking in my head "I've shared my passions with her,and she gets it."At the end of our meeting she decided to become a donor,but she gave me something extra that I haven't received from anyone else.She gave me a handmade wooden cross,small enough to carry with me.
As soon as she handed it to me,I knew it was a gift sent from God,through an act of friendship.It's a symbol of a partnership that is developing through this journey,a symbol of how God can send us messages and a symbol of new friendships to come throughout the summer and my time in the middle east.Finally,it's a symbol of the example of what it looks like to build relationships with people who will join you in sharing with the world.It's something I'll treasure through the rest of my summer campaign,through my service in the middle east,and the rest of my life.
21.What can be inferred about the author from the first paragraph?
A.He is a quick learner.							B.He enjoys trying new journeys.
C.He regrets joining in the summer campaign.		D.His summer campaign is delivering support.
22.What does the author's job require him to do?
A.Help others.			B.Raise support.			C.Share with others.		D.Work extra hours.
23.What did the lady do for the author?
A.She inspired passion in him.					B.She found a ministry for him.                  
C.She helped him clarify his doubt.				D.She gave him more than expected.
24.What does the author say about the cross?
A.It isn't portable due to its size.					B.It symbolizes many things to him.
C.It is donated by one of his old friends.			D.It has far-reaching influence on the giver.

There are more bicycles than residents in the Netherlands,and in cities 
like Amsterdam and The Hague up to 70% of all journeys are made by bike.
The BBC's reporter,Anna Holligan,examines what made everyone get back 
in the saddle（车座）
Before World WarⅡ,journeys in the Netherlands were mainly made by 
bike,but in the 1950s and 1960s,as car ownership increased quickly,this changed.As in many countries in Europe, roads became increasingly crowded.
The jump in car number caused a huge rise in the number of deaths on the roads.In 1971 more than 3,000 people were killed by motor vehicles,and 450 of them were children.In response a social movement demanding safer cycling conditions for children was formed.Called Stop de Kindermoord,it took its name from the headline of an article written by journalist Vic Langenhoff whose own child had been killed in a road accident.
The Dutch love of the motor vehicle was also shaken by the Middle East oil crisis of 1973,when oil-producing countries topped export to the US and Western Europe.
These twin pressures helped to persuade the Dutch government to invest in improving cycling infrastructure（基础设施）and the Dutch urban planners started to change from the road-building policies designed mainly for cars.
To make cycling safer and more inviting,the Dutch have built a vast network of cycle paths.These are clearly marked,have smooth surfaces,separate signs and lights for those on two wheels,and are wide enough to allow cycling side by side and overtaking.
Even before they can walk,Dutch children live in a world of cycling.As babies they travel in special seats on bikes.As the children grow up they ride their own bikes.And,as the Dutch are not allowed to drive until 18,cycling offers teenagers an alternative form of freedom.
The state also plays a part in teaching,with cycling lessons a compulsory（必修的）part in Dutch schools.All schools have places to park bikes and at some schools 90% of pupils cycle to class.

A.Why cycling is popular in the Netherlands.			
B.How journeys are made in the Netherlands.

The lesson here is for us to be good each other.

第二部分 阅读理解（共两节，满分40分）
第一节（共15小题：每小题2分，满分30分）
阅读下列短文，从每题所给的四个选项（A、B、C和D）中选出最佳选项，并在答题卡上将该项涂黑。
A
I sat with my friend in a well-known coffee shop in a neighboring town of Venice. As we enjoyed our coffee, a man called the waiter and placed his order, “Two cups of coffee, one on the wall.” We got interested and observed that he was served with one cup of coffee but he paid for two. As soon as he left, the waiter attached a piece of paper to the wall saying “A Cup of Coffee.” Similar occasions took place twice while we were there. It seemed that this gesture was quite normal at this place. However, it was something unique and confusing for us.
After a few days, when we again enjoyed coffee there, a man entered. The way this man was dressed did not match the standard or the atmosphere of this coffee shop. Poverty was evident from his looks. As he seated himself, he looked at the wall and said, “One cup of coffee from the wall.” The waiter served coffee to this man with respect and dignity. The man had his coffee and left without paying. We were amazed to watch all this when the waiter took off a piece of paper from the wall and threw it in the dustbin.
Now it was no surprise for us; the matter was very clear. The great respect for the needy shown by people in this town moved us to tears.
Coffee is not a necessity. However, the point is that when we take pleasure in any blessing, maybe we also need to think about those people who also appreciate that specific blessing but cannot afford.
Note the waiter, who gets the communication going between the affording and the needy with a smile on his face. Think about the man in need: he enters the coffee shop without having to lower his self-dignity; he has a free cup of coffee without asking or knowing about who has given this cup of coffee to him; he only looked at the wall, placed an order for himself, enjoyed his coffee and left. Besides, we need to remember the role played by the wall that reflects the generosity and care of people in this town.
21. What made the author interested as well as confused?
A. The waiter’s making normal gestures.		
B. Customers’ buying coffee for the needy.
C. The waiter’s attaching coffee orders on the wall.
D. Customers’ paying for coffee and having it put on the wall.
22. The author thought the man in need was ______.
A. obviously poor						B. not properly dressed
C. not right to leave without paying		    D. strange to order coffee from the wall
23. In the author’s opinion, coffee is _____.
A. necessary in our life					B. a blessing some can’t afford
C. respect shown for the needy			    D. a blessing everyone should have
24. The passage is mainly concerned about ______.
A. learning from the waiter				    B. buying coffee for others
C. caring more about the people in need	    D. analyzing the characters in the coffee shop
B
Running out of cooking oil or need some dressing for your salad? The solution may be bugs from your backyard! Scientists are turning insects into a source of eatable and healthy oil. Even though serving insects as dishes is common in some parts of the world, to many people, the thought of eating them is rather disgusting.
“In the Western countries, there is no culture of eating entire insects. So when the idea is to use the protein in powder as an ingredient(配料), people might tend to receive this protein better, on condition that they cannot see it.” said researcher Daylan Tzompas-Sosa, Wageningen University, Netherlands. “There are many uses for the oil in general, but we are investigating the use of these oils for a food, as a food ingredient.”
The Mexican researcher, working in the Netherlands, said insects are a great source of heart healthy omega-3 fatty acids, which can help treat anxiety disorder symptoms. Backing up the increased reliance on insects is the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. In a 2015 report, the UN agency approved the cultivation of bugs as a food source, saying it’s environmentally-friendly and could increase the world’s food production.
There are clear reasons that experts advise people to eat the insects. Experts say insects require little food to grow and that the backyard can be a good place to raise them. And there’s no shortage of protein-rich insects, which also contain fat, vitamins, fiber and minerals.
Researchers say different bugs provide unique tastes and textures. “This is very liquid and it has a different color, so this can be used as a dressing for example and it’s easy to use and this can be used for example for pastry(油酥面团), because for pastry you need hard fats,” stated Tzompas-Sosa.
But not all insects produce good oil. Cockroaches (蟑螂) don’t. The bug oils must be tested to make sure they are safe to consume. But getting over the “disgusting feeling” may be a bigger challenge.
25. What is the author’s attitude towards the use of bug oils?
A. Doubtful			B. Objective		C. Supportive		D. Unfavorable
26. Which of the following can replace the underlined phrase “Backing up”?
A. Raising         	B. Rejecting      C. Supporting    	D. Enjoying
27. From the last paragraph, we can learn that _____.
A. all insects cannot produce good oil		B. the bug oils are the most delicious
C. it’s safe to consume the bug oils		    D. the use of bug oils is banned

In ancient Egypt, a shopkeeper discovered that he could attract customers to his shop simply by making changes to its environment. Modern businesses have been following his lead, with more tactics（策略）.
One tactic involves where to display the goods. Foe example, stores place fruits and vegetables in the first section. They know that customers who buy the healthy food first will feel happy so that they will buy more junk food later in their trip. In department stores, the women’s shoe section is generally next to the women’s cosmetics section：while the shop assistant is going back to find the right size shoe, bored customers are likely to wander over and find some cosmetics they might want to try later. 
Besides, businesses seek to appeal to customers’ senses. Stores notice that the smell of baked goods encourages shopping, so they make their own bread each morning and then fan the bread smell into the store throughout the day. Music sells goods, too. Researchers in Britain found that when French music was played, sales of French wine went up. 
When it comes to the selling o f houses, businesses also use highly rewarding tactics. They find that customers make decisions in the first few seconds upon walking in the door, and turn it into a business opportunity. A California builder designed the structure of its houses smartly. When entering the house, the customer would see the Pacific Ocean through the windows, and then the pool through an open stairway leading to the lower level. The instant view of water on both levels helped sell these $10 million houses.
28.Why do stores usually display fruits and vegetables in the first section?
A. To save customers’ time.                B. To show they are high quality foods.
C. To help sell junk food.                  D. To sell them at discount prices.
29.According to Paragraph 3, which of the following encourages customers to buy?
A. Opening the store early in the morning.	  	B. Displaying British wines next to French ones.
C. Inviting customers to play music.		  	D. Filling the store with the smell of fresh bread.
30.What is the California builder’s story intended to prove?
A. The house structure is a key factor customers consider.
B. The more costly the house is, the better it sells.
C. An ocean view is much to the customers’ taste.
D. A good first impression increases sales.
31.What is the main purpose of the passage?
A. To explain how businesses turn people into their customers.
B. To introduces how businesses have grown from the past.
C. To report researches on customer behavior.
D. To show dishonest business practices.
D 
Ever feel like scratching yourself when you see others doing it? You’re probably not alone. This practice, which seems to be socially contagious (传染的), could be more than just a sudden urge. This is according to the latest finding from Washington University.
The researchers studied mice to see what went on in their brains when they saw other mice scratching. During the experiments, a mouse was placed in front of a computer screen to watch another of its kind scratching. A few moments after watching the video, the live mouse would start scratching. The finding is interesting because earlier studies had shown that mice only show empathy (共鸣) with individuals they know and the mouse on the screen was a stranger for the live mouse. This means that empathy may have nothing to do with the need to scratch.
When the researchers analyzed the brain activity of the mice after viewing the video, they recorded increased level of gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). In the previous research, GRP is found to be responsible for transferring the itch (痒) feeling between the brain and the skin. However, when researchers blocked the GRP’s function, the mice simply stopped scratching in response to seeing other mice scratching. This means that mice have no control over their scratching when seeing peers (同伴) scratching. The mouse doesn’t see another mouse scratching and then thinks it might need to scratch. Instead, its brain begins sending out itch signals using GRP as a messenger.
It’s not clear if the exact same pathway exists in humans. But the team believes the study could help throw light on the neural mechanisms (神经机制) behind contagious behaviors in human beings. The next time you scratch in response to someone else doing it, remember it’s really not a choice, nor a psychological response; it’s hardwired into your brain.
32. What have the latest experiments found?
A. Mice only imitate the act of their familiar peers.
  B. Mice prefer the mice on a computer screen to the live ones.
  C. Mice feel the need to scratch when seeing another scratching.
  D. Mice just have to scratch when seeing another scratching.
33. What can we learn about GRP?
  A. The mouse decreased its GRP when seeing other mice scratching.
  B. GRP is meant to block the itching and scratching feeling.
  C. Without GRP’s function, the mice wouldn’t copy the scratch.
  D. GRP exists and functions the same in human brains.
34. The underlined word “hardwired” in the last paragraph probably means ________.
  A. changed   			B. mended  			C. stopped   			D. fixed
35. Which is the best title?
  A. The Contagious Scratch              B. The Clever Imitation
C. The Strange Behavior                D. The Common Response

Do teenagers know how to sleep? If you’re the parent of teens, you might be laughing to yourself. That’s all they know how to do. In truth, teens might not know enough about how to sleep, when to sleep and why.     36    .
Just as we focus on our diets and exercise for health, we need to consider sleep necessary to our mental, physical and psychological health. “Good” sleep is sleep that is long enough to allow your brain to remove the side effects of daytime brain activity. Consistent bed times and wakeup times are the key to keeping our sleep cycles.    37    .
Teens are social creatures, and the most attractive social “gathering” place these days is on their digital devices.    38    . Ideally, we should avoid blue light for at least half an hour before bed. But social media and homework that requires screen time mean too many kids are powering up their devices when their bodies should be powering down for the night.
    39    . Equally contributing to sleep issues are eating too late, taking naps, and failing to get enough exercise. In other words, these people never learned how to sleep.
Over time, poor sleep leads to a decline in mood.    40    . Significantly, when I speak to my adult patients who are struggling with sleep issues, nearly all of them say their sleep problems started in high school.
Therefore, I recommend sleep education. Otherwise, we won’t necessarily solve the health, safety and economic issues of sleepy teens.
A. When they are disturbed, our sleep is affected 
B. Going to bed too late is only one part of sleep problems  
C. Being exposed to blue light from our screens delays sleep 
D. Current school schedules allow for about seven hours of sleep a night 
E. It also contributes to a lot of medical issues, from being fat to heart disease 
F. Later school start time really contributes to more sleep and improved health 
G. As far as I’m concerned, one important element is missing: sleep education

Where will you go to escape the stress of life and the noise of traffic? To find out, we turned to question-and-answer site Quora, where users have been sharing their opinions. From an Alpine palace in Germany to some amazing English views, these dreamy destinations are so magical that it’s hard to believe they’re real.
Gaudi’s otherworldly imagination
Designed by one of Spain’s most famous architects, Antoni Gauldi, the Roman Catholic
church Sagrada Familia is a legend in itself. Construction began in 1882, but less than a quarter of the project was complete when when Gaudi died in 1926. Since then, work has progressed slowly. How about the ending? Architects plan to complete the project in 2026, the centenary of Gaudi’s death.
As Barcelona’s most popular tourist site, Sagrada Familia attracts three million visitors every year for one good reason: It’s a masterpiece unlike anything else in the world which is largely responsible for the city’s lively personality.
A setting that could steal the spotlight from any storybook hero
With its valleys surrounded by lakes, rivers, hills and peaks, the Lake District in England’ s northwest is quite literally taken out of fairy tales. This place was Beatrix Potter’s inspiration for Peter Rabbit and the residence（居所）of the Lake Poets, including William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey.
One of nature’s most magical illusions
Once upon a time in the faraway land of the Faroe Islands, Lake Leitisvatn became known as the most striking of all the islands’ lakes. At more than 6km long, it is the biggest in the Faroe Islands. And as the star of a clever optical illusion, the lake appears as if it’s resting hundreds of metres above the sea, with the ocean churning（剧烈翻腾）beneath its waters. In reality, Lake Leitisvatn is actually no more than about 30m above sea level. A steep cliff in front of the lake and a clever camera angle make the lake appear to be much higher than it really is.
21. From the first paragraph, we know Quora is a site where you can        .
A. release your stress of life
B. ask your teachers questions
C. get different views about something
D. find guides to any magical attractions
22. What do you know about Sagrada Familia?
A. It hasn’t been fully built yet 						B. It is a museum about Antoni Gaudi
C. It was built in honor of Antoni Gaudi 				D. It tells much about Spain’s history
23. Where did Beatrix Potter create the fairy tale character Peter Rabbit?
A- On Lake Leitisvatn. 								B. In the Lake District.
From Sagrada Familia. 								D. At certain hills and peaks.

A fathcr-of-three, Steven Nome, has made history after donating two of his organs to
complete strangers. Steven chose to have 30 percent of his liver removed so that he could sat the life of a young child-four years after donating one of his kidneys to another recipient. 
Steven was very taken by the idea. He spent a few months considering it and at last he made the decision when he was out for a walk on New Year’s Day this year. At the time he was thinking about what he wanted to achieve this year. He knew it was his 40th birth y wanted to do something significant. When he told his doctors about this thought, there was great astonishment from them as nobody had yet donated a kidney and part of a liver to strangers. The majority of organs are donated to family, relatives or very close friends but here  you don’t I know who is going to get it.
Steven underwent surgery at Leeds St James’ Hospital following several months of assessments ments including an ECG, MRI and ultra-sound scans, blood testing and a psychological interview that confirmed he was in good health and was a suitable candidate. Steven thought it was a short-term discommodity for long-term benefit—A couple of months of reduced mobility and a bit of discomfort were a very small price to pay when you were aware you had saved a life. It got you through the darker moments.
Dr Lisa Bumapp, one of Steven’s doctors said, “More than 100 donors volunteer each year to donate a kidney to someone they do not know. However, liver donation is much less common. Mr. Norrie is the first double donor who gives two separate organs. Living donation is highly successful but most people do not have someone who can donate to them, and only some organs can be donated from a living person. Patients waiting for a transplant rely heavily on generous people donating their organs after death. To give an organ to a loved one is an incredible（难以置信的）act of generosity. That Steven has given twice to people he doesn’t know is truly remarkable.”
24. Steven decided to donate part of his liver because     .
A. he was unable to live long
B. he was the only suitable candidate
C. he wanted to save the life of his friend
D. he wanted to make his life more meaningful
25. Hearing Steven’s thought, the doctors were     .
A. shocked. 				B. concerned				C. confused				D. interested
26. The underlined word “discommodity” in Paragraph 2 probably means “    .”
A. sickness 				B. damage 				C. inconvenience 			D. dissatisfaction
27. Which word can best describe Steven Norrie?
A. Brave and smart.				 				B. Selfless and caring. 
C. Hardworking and generous.			 			D. Responsible and longsighted.

As more and more schools rush to put digital devices in the hands of every student, many parents are becoming increasingly concerned about the quality of their children’s education, The promise of increased student academic achievement through the use of technology hasn’t really produced any significant results in the past 20 years.
Researchers at the University of California Los Angeles conducted a study in 2014 to determine if the social skills of elementary students were blocked by screen time. Two groups of sixth grade students were compared. One group was sent to an outdoor camp tor one week with no screen time, while the control group live life as normal. After one week, the students at comp had made significant improvements over their peers（同龄人）. The good news is that when we limit access to screen time and give children the opportunity to interact face to face, they quickly become better at reading non-verbal cues（非言语暗示）and determining the emotional state of others. The bad news is that we have a generation of children that struggle with this basic emotional intelligence skill.
Too much screen time has been linked to childhood obesity, sleep disorders, behavior problems, and academic challenges. But is there a difference between schoolwork and entertainment media?
When students are using technology for academic work they are more likely to be communicating with peers, working cooperatively, and developing other important skills. However，all these are impossible when students watch entertainment media. They just sit and watch!
Parents have right to be concerned about their children’s screen time at school, but they should begin by discussing the use of digital media at home. Some parents are continuously engaged in their own devices, responding to every ring of their phones, receiving and sending messages. How can they expect their children to do better?
28. What was the schools’ initial intention of using digital devices?
A. To improve students academically.
B. To help students develop socially.
C. To make school life more entertaining and colorful.
D . To make sure students get technological education.
29. What aspect of children worries the writer a lot?
A. Lacking guidance on proper screen time.
B. Lacking chances to communicate with other,
C. Lacking interest in improving their study
D. Lacking skills in reading others’ emotional state.
30. What attitude does the writer have to the use of digital devices in schoolwork?
A. Positive. 				B. Concerned.				C. Negative. 				D. Uncertain
31. From the passage, we can learn that        .
A. parents shouldn’t oppose schools in their educational approaches
B. some parents may set a bad example to their children in using distal media
C. the screen watching time shouldn’t be longer than 2 hours for students
D. it’s wrong for schools to focus on technological education
D
Companion planting is the idea that some kinds of plants can help each other grow. Plants that are compatible（可共存的）together generally have similar needs in terms of nutrients, soil and moisture levels.
Advice about which plants are compatible is sometimes based more on tradition than proof. But experts say there is evidence to support certain combinations. These can improve harvests, reduce disease and help with pest control by attracting helpful insects.
For example, some kinds of soil bacteria take nitrogen（氮）from the air and make it into a form that plants can use. The plants hold the nitrogen in their roots. Legumes （豆科植物）are especially good at this nitrogen-fixing. Then any crops that share the same space with the legumes can get the nitrogen when the roots are broken down.
Beans and potatoes can also share territory well because their roots reach different levels in the soil. Deep-rooted vegetables get nutrients and moisture from lower down in the soil, so they do not compete with plants with shallower roots.
But some plants placed together may harm each other’s development. For example, tomatoes do not like wet soil but watercress does, so you would probably want to keep them separated.
Some kinds of produce should be kept apart even after being harvested. This is because of ethylene gas（乙烯气体）. Ethylene is a plant hormone（激素） that can cause some foods to ripen too quickly. Apples release ethylene gas. Apricots, melons and tomatoes also release a lot of ethylene. Some vegetable are easily affected by ethylene, including asparagus, broccoli, cabbage and cucumbers. 
This risk ripening too soon is why markets often separate high ethylene-producing foods from those that are sensitive to the gas. But if you put an apple in a bag with a green banana, the ethylene from the apple will make the banana ready to eat sooner.
What about peaches, plums and nectarines? These kinds of fruit do not need any help from an apple-they release enough ethylene to ripen themselves. But that does not mean there is no way to get the job done faster.

Dear editors,
I’m writing to share my views on sharing economy. Nowadays, a range of products including shared bikes, cars and umbrellas can be rented if you need. The sharing economy has brought us convenience in our life.
However, problems brought by the sharing economy have become increasingly worse, such as the lack of market supervision, dishonesty merchants and bad users. 
Therefore, the sharing economy should be taken very seriously. Firstly, more strict policies and laws should be made. Secondly, companies should do more surveys about the market to improve the products or services. Besides, more cooperation and discussion should be carried out among the government, the merchants and the users.
Yours sincerely,
Li Hua

My grandmother pointed at a picture of a six-year-old me and asked, “Sweetie, do you see that?” 
Studying my younger self, I smiled and nodded.
“That’s my granddaughter.” Grandma said. “She lives in Connecticut. She must be…Well, I’ve forgotten how old she’d be now! ” 
My smile froze and my hands began to shake. My grandmother had Alzheimer’s disease. It seemed impossible for her to be able to look after herself. Gradually, not remembering where she placed her glasses became not remembering where her house was, which became not always remembering my name. My birthday gifts from Grandma used to be highly expected; she always knew exactly what to get and her cards would make me smile. Now, my gift from her is really from my father, who buys a present in her name since she doesn’t remember when my birthday is. A birthday card without her writing just reminds me that my grandmother isn’t the same anymore. 
I feel sad about it and I find a great comfort through writing. Writing my memories on paper helps me to deal with what is happening and to see Grandma as what she truly is. I have hopes of someday soon writing a novel about the Alzheimer’s struggle, so that I might help others who are experiencing the same pains deal with the realities of losing a loved one this way. Strangely enough, recording my sadness reduced some of the pain. I know it’s her strength that pulls me through the hard times. That is the character I have wanted to have since I was a child, and it does not change, no matter how weak her mind has become. So now, when I sit on the chair next to Grandma and know she can’t remember my name, I swallow the bitter medicine of disappointment and smile.

A. Cold.		    B. Calm.          C. Appreciative.	    	D. Unclear.
26. What does the underlined word in Paragraph 5 refer to?

   B. The birthday card was really from Dad.
   C. Grandmother couldn’t remember the author’s birthday.
   D. That grandmother wasn’t the same because of her disease.
27. What is the best title for the text?
A. The bitter medicine of disappointment   		   B. A great comfort through writing	     
C. My grandmother 	   		                   D. My birthday gift

If you are a wealthy person of India, madly in love and planning your big fat wedding----or being pressured into arranged marriage----Thailand wants you to exchange vows(誓言) in Bangkok, Phuket(普吉岛) or elsewhere in this “wedding paradise”.
This wedding business starts from overseas with the Indians. Thai embassies in India give quick services for the visas. Not only the couples, you can bring anyone, say, your own cook. So, feel free to invite hundreds of your friends and relatives.
Why would Indians want to spend so much on weddings in Thailand? Partly because they have similarities in religion. When Indian weddings want to have some religious prayer for the couples, Thailand can do that. But the more obvious appeal are Thailand’s fancy hotels, tropical islands, and delicious Thai food, allowing new couples to include a honeymoon in Thailand after they say “I do” while their guests also celebrate on a holiday here. But on the other hand, love does have a price.
Kasu Rajagopal arranged for his daughter to have a wedding in Phuket. They arranged entertainment to begin three days before the wedding because guests arrival time varied. Yachts(游艇) were arranged to take guests to small islands, while a DJ from Bangalore, India, was booked to help them dance in the evening. Kasu also arranged priests(祭祀) for the Hindu wedding, and cooks to prepare Indian food. The approximate costs are around half a million US dollars, including the airfares, hotel accommodation, food, transportation, the yachts on hire and the wedding ceremony expenses, for 225 to 250 guests.
Thailand wants to make itself a wedding paradise for all couples, not just from India, but from around the world. Last year, there were around 500 to 600 couples from China, and the numbers are slowly coming up. Westerners also arrive to get married, but in much smaller numbers.
28. The Indians would go to Thailand for weddings mainly because______.
A. they will be pressured into arranged married in India.
B. India shares the same religion as Thailand
C. Thailand offers them more than just a wedding ceremony.
D. Guests are not satisfied with Indian weddings.
29. What can we learn from the text?
A. Guests do not need visas to get into Thailand.
B. Changing vows is a necessary step for an Indian wedding.
C. Islands are all people’s first honeymoon destination choice.
D. Some Indians prefer the food prepared by their own cooks.
30. Kasu Rajagopal’s example in the fourth paragraph shows_____.
A. it may cost you a fortune to have such a wedding
B. you can bring whatever you want to Thailand
C. what Thailand offers hardly satisfies customers’ needs
D. there are quite a few activities after the wedding
31. What can we learn from the last paragraph?
A. Cost of weddings in Thailand will be reduced.
B. More people will get married in Thailand.
C. Fewer westerners will have Thai weddings.
D. Chinese will be Thailand’s No.1 customers.
D
We live in a sweet world. The average American kid consumes more than 20 teaspoons of sugar per day, and adults eat 50% more sugar today than they did in the 1970s. We all know that too much sugar isn’t good for you. But did we know it could be dangerous? A team of researchers at the University of Utah used mice to conduct a study to prove the toxic effects of eating more sugar. They found it could influence people’s health seriously.
During the 58-week-long study, mice were fed a diet containing 25% more sugar. This percentage equals a healthy human diet along with three cans of soda daily. The team found that these mice were twice as likely to die as mice fed a similar diet without the sugar. Though the mice did not show signs of obesity or high blood pressure, male mice produced 25% fewer offspring than the other mice.
The reason why mice were chosen for research by scientists are not far to seek. “Mice have the genetic structure similar to humans. Most substances that are harmful to mice are also harmful to people. It’s likely that those underlying physical problems that cause those mice to have increased the death rate are at play in people,” says study author James Ruff of the University of Utah. Findings from this study reveal negative effects that are not as detectable as weight gain or heart problems. Sugar can contribute to long-term changes in the body that can alter development and even shorten lives.
Different types of sugar have different effects on the human body. Some of the sugar we consume comes from foods we might expect----candy, soda, and cookies. But much of the sugar that we eat if hidden. Food companies add large amounts of sugar to items we may not classify as sweets. To help cut down on extra sugar consumption, nutrition experts suggest looking at the ingredients(原料) on food packages. Cutting sugar out of the American diet altogether may be difficult. But making the effort to control our nation’s sugar cravings will provide for a truly sweeter future.
32. The underlined word “toxic” in Paragraph i probably means “______”.
    A. ridiculous         B. skeptical        C. poisonous       D. reasonable
33. According to Paragraph 2, we can know ______.
    A. the study conducted on mice lasted less than a year.
    B. the study shows the bad effects of more sugar on mice.
    C. mice eating more sugar than others live longer
    D. mice eating more sugar will become fatter and fatter
34. Why did the scientists choose the mice to conduct the study?
    A. They have a similar genetic structure to humans.
    B. They are sensitive to the taste of the sweet.
    C. They are easy to take in the harmful substances.
    D. They have a longer lifespan than other animals.
35. Which suggestion is put forward by nutrition experts?
    A. Choosing the food without any sugar to eat.
    B. Buying the food rich in sugar to consume.
    C. Eating the food with sugar hidden in it.

Dear Tom,
I am more than delighted to know you show great interest in shared bikes which have received increasing attention home and abroad.It is my pleasure to introduce them to you. 
When you spot a shared bike,what you need to do is just scan the QR code of the bike to unlock it and enjoy your trip. Not only are shared bikes environmentally friendly and convenient, but also they charge low rates and can be parked almost anytime and anywhere, which has given them advantages over other means of public transport. 
With Mobike entering the UK, I can't help but wonder about its situation there. Could you please be kind enough to tell me something about that?
Yours sincerely,
LiHua

So many of us hold on to little complaints that may have come from an argument, a misunderstanding, the way we were raised, or some other painful events. Stubbornly, we wait for someone else to reach out to us—believing this is the only way we can forgive or rekindle a friendship or family relationship.
A friend of mine, recently told me that she hadn't spoken to her son in almost three years. She said that she and her son had had a disagreement about his wife and that she wouldn't speak to him again unless he called first. When I suggested that she be the one to reach out, she said, “I can't do that. He's the one who should apologize.” After a little gentle encouragement, however, she did decide to be the first one to reach out. To her amazement, her son was grateful for her willingness to call and offered an apology of his own. As is usually the case when someone takes the chance and reaches out, everyone wins.
Whenever we hold on to our anger, we turn small stuff(问题)” into really “big stuff” in our minds. We start to believe that our positions are more important than our happiness. They are not. If you want to be a more peaceful person you must understand that being right is almost never more important than allowing yourself to be happy. The way to be happy is to let go, and reach out. Let other people be right. This doesn't mean that you're wrong. Everything will be fine. You'll experience the peace of letting go, as well as the joy of letting others be right.
You'll also notice that, as you reach out and let others be right，” they will become less defensive and more loving toward you. They might even reach back. But, if for some reason they don't, that's okay too. You'll have the inner satisfaction of knowing that you have done your part to create a more loving world, and certainly you'll be more peaceful yourself.
4．The underlined word “rekindle” in Paragraph 1 probably means “________”．
A．recover	B．develop
C．accept	D．replace
5．In the author's opinion, we hold on to our anger often because we think ________.
A．we can turn small issues into big ones
B．our positions are higher than others
C．our own opinions matter most
D．others will be less defensive 
6．The best thing to do after a quarrel is to ______.
A．let go of our own rights
B．realize that you are wrong
C．expect others to give in
D．apologize to others first
7．What would be the best title for the passage? 
A．Be Peaceful	B．Reach Out and Give
C．Small and Big Stuff	D．Enjoy Your Friendship
                                       C
The number of American students who learned a language other than English decreased by about 100,000 between 2009 and 2013. For many, taking a class in economics might seem more beneficial than a French course. But is it real?
The Chinese dialects combined already have more native speakers than any other language, followed by Hindi and Urdu. English comes next with 527 million native speakers. Arabic is spoken by nearly 100 million more native speakers than Spanish, which has 389 million speakers.
Which languages will dominate the future? Predictions vary, depending on your location and purpose.
You want to make money in growth markets? These will be your languages.
A recent U．K.­focused report features languages spoken in the so­called BRIC countries—Brazil, Russia, India, China—that are usually known as the world's biggest emerging economies. Hindi, Bengali, Urdu and Indonesian will control much of the business world by 2050, followed by Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Russian. If you want to get the most money out of your language course, studying one of the languages listed above is probably a safe bet.
You want to speak to as many people as possible? How about Chinese, Spanish or French?
1．Chinese. Although Chinese has three times more native speakers than English, it's still not as evenly spread over the world. Moreover, Chinese is rarely used in sciences and difficult to read and write.
2. Spanish. Spanish makes up for a lack of native speakers­compared with China—by being particularly popular as a second language, taught in schools around the world.
3. French. French has lost grounds in some regions and especially in Europe in the last decades. French, however, could gain influence again if west Africa where it is frequently spoken were to become more politically stable and economically attractive.
8．How many native speakers of Arabic are there?
A．100 million.	B．389 million.
C．489 million.	D．527 million.
9．Those who want to make money in growth market might be  more interested in ________.
A．Spanish, Arabic and Chinese
B．Bengali, Urdu and Indonesian
C．Portuguese, German and French
D．Japanese, Italian and Chinese
10．What do we know about Spanish from the passage?
A．It is learnt mostly by themselves.
B．It's popular as a second language.
C．It is widely spoken by native speakers.
D．It will be spoken most in the business world
11．What's the author's attitude towards foreign language learning?
A．Favorable.     B．Negative.     C．Doubtful.	   D．Neutral.
D
   According to a survey, only 4% of the people in the world are left-handed. Why? One theory centers on the two halves of the brain. For example, the left half and the right half, each of which functions differently. Medical science believes that the left half of the brain dominates over the right half. The foundation of this theory is the fact that nerves from the brain cross over at neck-level to the opposite side of the body, and nerves from the other side of the brain reciprocate (互换). The end re­sult is that the opposite sides of the body are controlled by the opposite sides of the brain.
  The dominant left half of the brain, which kindly supplies the right half of the body, theoretically makes it more skillful in read­ing, writing, speaking, and working, and makes most people right-handed. Lefties, however, whose right half of the brain dominates, work best with the left side of their bodies.
  Theory number two focuses on the asymmetrical nature of the body. Examples of the asymmetry, which flows from head to toe, are that the right side of our faces differs slightly from the left, that our legs differ in strength, or that our feet vary in size. One aspect of this asymmetry is that for most people the right hand is stronger than the left.
  There is no doubt that all exist in a “right-handed society”, which produces most basics, including scissors, doorknobs, locks, screwdrivers, automobiles, buttons on clothing, and musical instru­ments for the 96%. Left-handed people make up for the unfairness by being members of an elite (精英) society, which includes many of the greatest geniuses, including Michelangelo and Leonardo 
Davinci.
12. Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage?
A. Left-handed people are better at speaking 
B. Left-handed people are believed to have stronger left halves of the brains     
C. Right-handed people work best with the right side of their bodies 
D. Right-handed people are cleverer than left-handed people  
13. Which of the words or phrases is closest in meaning to the word “asymmetrical”?
    A. not balanced 		B. valuable       C. not typical     	D. negative
    14. What can be inferred from the passage?
A. This is an equal society for the left-handed people
B. Most great geniuses are left-handed     
C. Left-handed people are considered to be disabled 
D. Left-handed people may feel inconvenient in this right-handed society 
    15. What’s the best title for the passage?
A. Which proves to be the better way to live, right-handed or left-handed?
B. How do left-handed people differ from right-handed ones?
C. Are left-handed people equally treated in society? 
D. Why are some people left-handed?

In order to organize it successfully, we made full preparations. Before the sale, from the students we collected various used books, second-hand goods which were still in good condition and classified them. When the day came, students and teachers all came and took an active part in it. At the end of the activity, we raised 5000 yuan in total.

When I was nine years old, I loved to go fishing with my dad. But the only thing that wasn’t very fun about it was that he could catch many fish while I couldn’t catch anything. I usually got pretty upset and kept asking him why. He always answered, “Son, if you want to catch a fish, you have to think like a fish”, I remember being even more upset then because, “I’m not a fish!” I didn’t know how to think like a fish. Besides, I reasoned, how could what I think influence what a fish does?
As I got a little older I began to understand what my dad really meant. So, I read some books on fish. And I even joined the local fishing club and started attending the monthly meetings. I learned that a fish is a cold-blooded animal and therefore is very sensitive to water temperature. That is why fish prefer shallow water to deep water because the former is warmer. Besides, water is usually warmer in direct sunlight than in the shade. Yet, fish don’t have any eyelids(眼皮) and the sun huts their eyes… The more I understood fish, the more I became effective at finding and catching them..
When I grew up and entered the business world, I remember hearing my first boss say, “We all need to think like sales people.” But it didn’t completely make sense. My dad never once said, “If you want to catch a fish you need to think like a fisherman.” What he said was, “You need to think like a fish.” Years later, with great efforts to promote long-term services to people much older and richer than me, I gradually learned what we all need is to think more like customers. It is not an easy job. I will show you how in the following chapters.

C
Why do Americans struggle with watching their weight, while the French, who consume rich food, continue to stay thin? Now a research by Cornell University suggests how life style and decisions about eating may affect weight. Researchers concluded that the French tend to stop eating when they feel full. However, Americans tend to stop when their plate is empty or their favorite TV show is over.
According to Dr. Joseph Mercola, a health expert, the French see eating as an important part of their life style. They enjoy food and therefore spend a fairly long time at the table, while Americans see eating as something to be squeezed between the other daily activities. Mercola believes Americans lose the ability to sense when they are actually full. So they keep eating long after the French would have stopped. In addition, he points out that Americans drive to huge supermarkets to buy canned and frozen foods for the week. The French, instead, tend to shop daily, walking to small shops and farmers’ markets where they have a choice of fresh fruits, vegetables, and eggs as well as high-quality meats for each meal.
After a visit to the United States, Mireille Guiliano, author of French Women Don’t Get Fat, decided to write about the importance of knowing when to stop rather than suggesting how to avoid food. Today she continues to stay slim and rarely goes to the gym.
In spite of all these differences, evidence shows that recent life style changes may be affecting French eating habits. Today the rate of obesity or extreme overweight among adults is only 6%. However, as American fast food gains acceptance and the young reject older traditions, the obesity rate among French children has reached 17% and is growing.
30. In what way are the French different from Americans according to Dr. Joseph Mercola?
A. They go shopping at supermarkets more frequently.      
B. They squeeze eating between the other daily activities.
C. They regard eating as a key part of their lifestyles.
D. They usually eat too much canned and frozen food.
31. This text is mainly the relationship between _________.
A. Americans and the French           B. life style and obesity
C. children and adults                 D. fast food and overweight
32. Where does this text probably come from?
A. A TV interview         B. A food advertisement    
C. A health report         D. A book review
D
People aren’t walking any more-if they can figure out a way to avoid it.
I felt superior about this matter until the other day I took my car to mail a small parcel. The journey is a matter of 281 steps. But I used the car. And I wasn’t in a hurry, either, I had merely become one more victim of a national sickness: motorosis.
It is an illness to which I had thought myself immune(免疫的), for I was born in the tradition of going to places on my own two legs. At that time, we regarded 25 miles as good day’s walk and the ability to cover such a distance in ten hours as sign of strength and skill. It did not occur to us that walking was a hardship. And the effect was lasting. When I was 45 years old I raced-and beat-a teenage football player the 168 steps up the Stature of Liberty.
Such enterprises today are regarded by many middle-aged persons as bad for the heart. But a well-known British physician, Sir Adolphe Abrhams, pointed out recently that hearts and bodies need proper exercise.A person who avoids exercise is more likely to have illnesses than one who exercises regularly. And walking is an ideal form of exercise-the most familiar and natural of all.
It was Henry Thoreau who showed mankind the richness of going on foot. The man walking can learn the trees, flowers, insects, birds and animals, the significance of seasons, the very feel of himself as a living creature in a living world, He cannot learn in a car.
The car is a convenient means of transport, but we have made it our way of life. Many people don’t dare to approach Nature any more; to them the world they were born to enjoy is all threat. To them security is a steel river thundering on a concrete road. And much of their thinking takes place while waiting for the traffic light to turn green.
I say that the green of forests is the mind’s best light. And none but the man on foot can evaluate what is basic and everlasting.
33. What is the national sickness?
  A. Walking too much                B. Traveling too much
  C. Driving cars too much             D. Climbing stairs too much.
34. What was life like when the author was young?
  A. People usually went around on foot.
B. people often walked 25 miles a day
C. People used to climb the Statue of Liberty. 
D. People considered a ten-hour walk as a hardship.
35. What is the author’s intention of writing this passage?
  A. To tell people to reflect more non life.
  B. To recommend people to give up driving
  C. To advise people to do outdoor activities
  D. To encourage people to return to walking

Do you remember the name of your kindergarten teacher clearly? I can remember  61  (I). Her name is Mrs White. But I don’t remember much about  62   we learned in her class. My mother once told me that Mrs White often asked us    63   (write) a lot. I would bring back what I wrote and my mother would look at it   64  (careful). What worried her a lot was that there were no red corrections about the mistakes
One day when my mother went to meet Mrs White for one of those Parent- Teacher meetings. She  65  (ask) Mrs White why she never corrected my mistakes and pointed out my grammar errors. Mrs White said “The children are just beginning to get  66  （excite）about using words and forming sentences. I don’t want to damage their interests with red ink. Spelling and grammar can wait  67  the wonder of words won’t...”. 
I grow up with time  68  (go) by . And it occurs to me that if Mrs White had used her red pen more precisely, I probably wouldn’t be telling you about this now. To bloom is  69  (good) than not to bloom. And thanks   70   Mrs White. I had no fear about writing what I meant even if I couldn’t quite spell it out.  Life isn’t Pretty. but it’s beautiful.

This is a true story of a mother’s sacrifice (牺牲) in an earthquake. When the rescuers reached the ruins of a young woman’s house, they saw her dead body through the cracks. Her pose was somehow strange---she knelt (跪) on the ground like a person who was worshiping (祷告)；her body was leaning forward, and her two hands were supported by an object. However, the cold and stiff body told them that she had passed away for sure.
The rescuers left this house and were going to search the next collapsed (倒塌的) building. For some reason, the team leader was driven by a strange force to go back to the ruined house. Again, he knelt down to search the little space under the dead body. Suddenly, he screamed with excitement, “ A child! There is a child!”
The whole team worked together; carefully they removed the piles of ruined objects around the dead woman. There was a 3-month-old little boy wrapped in a blanket under his mother’s dead body. Obviously, the woman had made great sacrifice in order to save her son. When her house was falling, she used her body to make a cover to protect her son. The little boy was still sleeping peacefully when the team leader picked him up.
A doctor came quickly to examine the little boy. After he opened the blanket, he saw a cellphone inside the blanket. There was a text message on the screen. It said, “ If you can survive, you must remember that I love you.” Everybody that read the message cried.
25.Why did the young woman kneel on the ground?
A. To protect herself from the earthquake.
B. To show respect for God.
C. To ask God for help.
D. To protect her baby.

27.What’s the writer’s purpose in writing this passage?
A. To prove that a cat has nine lives.

C. To express his thanks to the rescuers.
D. To give advice on how to rescue others.

Cities usually have a good reason for being where they are, like a nearby port or river. People settle in these places because they are easy to get to and naturally suited to communications and trade. New York City, for example, is near a large harbour at the mouth of the Hudson River. Over 300 years its population grew gradually from 800 people to 8 million. But not all cities develop slowly over a long period of time. Boom towns grow from nothing almost overnight. In 1896, Dawson, Canada, was unmapped wilderness(荒野). But gold was discovered there in 1897, and two years later, it was one of the largest cities in the West, with a population of 30,000. 
Dawson did not have any of the natural conveniences of cities like London or Paris. People went there for gold. They travelled over snow-covered mountains and sailed hundreds of miles up icy rivers. The path to Dawson was covered with thirty feet of wet snow that could fall without warming. An avalanche(雪崩) once closed the path, killing 63 people. For many who made it to Dawson, however, the rewards were worth the difficult trip. Of the first 20,000 people who dug for gold, 4,000 got rich. About 100 of these stayed rich men for the rest of their lives.
But no matter how rich they were, Dawson was never comfortable. Necessities like food and wood were very expensive. But soon, the gold that Dawson depended on had all been found. The city was crowded with disappointed people with no interest in settling down, and when they heard there were new gold discoveries in Alaska, they left Dawson City as quickly as they had come. Today, people still come and go — to see where the Canadian gold rush happened. Tourism is now the chief industry of Dawson City — its present population is 762.
28.What attracted the early settlers to New York City?
A. Its business culture.	B. Its small population.
C. Its geographical position.	D. Its favourable climate.
29.What do we know about those who first dug for gold in Dawson?
A. Two-thirds of them stayed there.
B. One out of five people got rich.
C. Almost everyone gave up.
D. Half of them died.
30.What was the main reason for many people to leave Dawson?
A. They found the city too crowded.
B. They wanted to try their luck elsewhere.
C. They were unable to stand the winter.
D. They were short of food.
31.What is the text mainly about?
A. The rise and fall of a city.	B. The gold rush in Canada.
C. Journeys into the wilderness.	D. Tourism in Dawson.
D
 We are all interested in equality, but while some people try to protect the school and examination system in the name of equality, others, still in the name of equality, want only to destroy it. 
    Any society which is interested in equality of opportunity and standards of achievement must regularly test its pupils. The standards may be changed — no examination is perfect — but to have no tests or examination would mean the end of equality and of standards. There are groups of people who oppose this view and who do not believe either in examinations or in any controls in schools or on teachers. This would mean that everything would depend on luck since every pupil would depend on the efficiency, the values and the purpose of each teacher.
Without examinations, employers will look for employees from the highly respected schools and from families known to them — a form of favoritism will replace equality at the moment. The bright child from an ill-respected school can show certificates to prove he or she is suitable for a job, while the lack of certificate indicates the unsuitability of a dull child attending a well-respected school. This defense of excellence and opportunity would disappear if examinations were taken away, and the bright child from a poor family would be a prisoner of his or her school’s reputation, unable to compete for employment with the child from the favored school.
 The opponents(反对者) of the examination system suggest that examinations are an evil force because they show differences between pupils. According to these people, there must be no special, different, academic class. They have even suggested that there should be no form of difference in sport or any other area: all jobs or posts should be filled by unsystematic selection. The selection would be made by people who themselves are probably selected by some computer.
32.The word “favoritism” in paragraph 3 is used to describe the phenomenon that _________.
A. bright children also need certificates to get satisfying jobs.
B. poor children with certificates are favored in job markets.
C. children from well-respected schools tend to have good jobs.
D. children attending ordinary schools achieve great success.
33.What would happen if examinations were taken away according to the author?
A. Schools for bright children would lose their reputation.
B. Children’s job opportunity would be affected by their school reputation.
C. Children from poor families would be able to change their schools.
D. There would be more opportunities and excellence.
34.The opponents of the examination system will agree that _________.
A. schools with academic subjects should be done away with
B. computers should be selected to take over many jobs
C. special classes are necessary to keep the school standards
D. jobs should not be assigned by systematic selection
35.The passage mainly focuses on _________.
    A. examination and equality	B. schools and certificates
C. opportunity and employment	D. standards and reputation

They told me they were looking at the Temple of Heaven. I led them the nearby bus stop and advised them to take Bus No. 20, that could take them there directly. They appreciated my help greatly. Several minute later the bus came. We wave goodbye to each other. Seeing him on the bus, I felt a sense of achievement. I thought, "What important it is to learn English well!"

A
 Dry ice is CO2 in solid form, with a temperature of about -78.5℃.Unlike common ice, dry ice doesn't melt into a liquid . When dry ice melts, it turns into a gas. So when you see dry ice "smoking", it's frozen CO2 melting into its gaseous state. Dry ice is a popular matter in scientific experiments. It creates projects that look cool.
     Experiment: Healthy dry ice popsicles（棒冰）
     This dry ice experiment will catch people's eye, especially little kids' because the dry ice is going to be used to make what the young love to eat. It should take you about 10 minutes or less to have a frozen treat to enjoy.
     Materials
     One large block of dry ice
     A large spoon
     Popsicle sticks
     One cup of your favorite juice
     A tall glass filled with water
Directions
     Use the large spoon to make a popsicle-shaped space in a block of dry ice. You can set the ice on a piece of cloth on your table to do this work. Of course, keep in mind that it's okay if it's not exactly popsicle-shaped.
     Add a popsicle stick to the middle of the space so that when you pour in the liquid, it will freeze around the popsicle stick.
     Hold the popsicle stick in place and wait a few minutes for your popsicle to harden. After several minutes, take away the popsicle from the block of dry ice and put it into a tall glass of water for a few seconds. Do this to warm up the popsicle just a bit. Otherwise, it will be too cold.

 22. What's the first step to do the experiment?
   A. To fill the tall glass with juice.          
B. To pour the juice into the space.
   C. To make space in the dry ice for juice.    
D. To put a stick to the middle of the dry ice.
 23. How does the dry ice work in the experiment?
    A. It gives out "smoke".                 B. It is mixed in the juice.
C. It makes the juice freeze.              D. It makes the popsicle look cool.

     Some of Australian cyclists have used "GPS art" to turn a 202 km (125- mile) ride into the outline of a goat, which interests many people greatly.
     The four men marked their route on an app before using it track their journey around Perth. When uploaded to the computer, it was shown as a picture. Cyclist Ben Jones said the group settled on a goat because it was an easy animal to draw. He said the ride lasted more than six hours, with the four men stopping only for food, and flat tyres . "Except for riding 202km, it's relatively simple," Mr. Jones told the BBC. "You mainly mark your route on the app and it plans directions out."
     GPS art has also been widely used by runners and other cyclists when they travel out. Mr. Jones said his group wanted to shake up their normal weekend ride. "We all ride l0,000km to 15,000km a year," he said. "Mostly we just ride together as mates and have a good time － that's what this was about."
     The group received much attention after posting their map to social media this week.  Others described Mr. Jones as a goat guy in an interview on Australian television. For their next piece of GPS art, the group plans to draw a local animal such as the koala. "Certainly, there'll be something coming, for we are making our decisions to put more and more plans into practice. I'm sure of that," Mr. Jones said.
24. What holds many people's attention greatly?
   A. The cyclists' shaping the route into the outline of a goat.  
   B. The cyclists' having the GPS to travel with.
   C. The cyclists' having traveled 125 miles.
   D. The cyclists' riding more than 6 hours.
25. What did the four men do during their six-hour ride?
   A. They had their bikes repaired.          B. They got something to eat.
   C. They stopped to have a rest.            D. They planned new directions.
26. How would Mr. Jones feel about their ride?  
   A. It was tiring.        B. It was enjoyable.   
C. It was moving.      D. It was amazing.
27. What does the underlined word "that" in the last paragraph refer to?
   A. Mr. Jones becoming a goat guy.        
 B. People paying attention to the map.
   C. The group drawing the animal koala.    
   D. The group performing their ride plans.

Have you ever been given something you don’t like or doesn’t fit, but you don’t want to hurt the feelings of the person who thinks about you? You’re not alone. Everyone has received an unwanted gift at least once in his or her life. That doesn’t mean the item is bad or useless. It simply means that it doesn’t work for you.
If you find yourself with something nice but that doesn’t fit into your lifestyle, consider regifting it. Before you do that, make sure you understand the manners of this practice that is more and more common as people find it difficult to make ends meet to a great extent.
There are specific things you should do to an item. Failure to do any of them may create an awkward situation. You never have to lie about what you are doing, but you don’t want to be in the position of having to explain anything. For example, remove the original wrapping paper and rewrap it in your own; make sure the box is in good condition so the item doesn’t appear used; check the item and make sure there are no cards or names on the packaging; inspect the item and make sure it is in excellent condition.
When you get ready for regifting, consider having a white elephant gift exchange for your next celebration. This removes all the embarrassment of being caught regifting because that’s the whole purpose of the event. In order to prevent hurting feelings, provide everyone with a guest list and ask them not to bring anything given by the people on that list.
28. Why does the author begin the passage with a question?
A. To share a hot phenomenon.	B. To introduce the following part.
C. To ask for readers’ answers.	D. To point out a common opinion.
29. What most contributes to the growing regifting?
	A. People’s lack of money.   	
B. People’s dislike of the gifts.  	
	C. People’s reduced desire for gifts.   	
D. People’s understanding of its manners.
30. What’s mainly talked about in Paragraph 3?
	A. What to do before regifting.	
B. How to make use of unwanted gifts. 
	C. What kind of gifts to be regifted.	
D. Why regifting can cause embarrassment.
31. What does the underlined phrase in the last paragraph mean?
	A. Suitable but valueless.             B. Expensive and useful.  	
C. Packaged and invaluable.	D. Nice but unsuitable.
D
     The idea that you can use humor, laughter, and play to make you healthier probably seems too simple to be true. However, it is really true and simple. The sense of humor, laughter and play has an important part in keeping you healthy.
     Use "the best medicine" to treat the blues with a sense of humor, which is closely tied to laughter. Laughter is infectious. Have you ever heard a big laugh of a young child and been able to keep yourself from smiling? When laughter is shared between people, it makes them closer to each other and increases their happiness. Smiling is the beginning of laughter and a smile is also just as infectious as laughter is. You can experience something by smiling at everyone around you, and you will feel happier just by sharing a smile, even with a stranger.
Play is an important part of making sure that we stay healthy. We are often encouraged to make sure our children play, and are told of the benefits of being out playing. However, what we often forget is that it is just as important for old people to make play be part of their life as it’s for children. Physical play is important for the old and it certainly helps prevent illness. While the studies are still in the early stages, the studies that have been done have shown that physical play certainly plays a part in preventing cognitive(认知的) falling.
     Anyway, adding humor, laughter, and play to our life will influence us mentally, physically and socially and bring us many advantages. So we should make full use of humor, laughter and play to make our life more active, interesting and happier.       
32. What does the underlined word "infectious" in Paragraph 2 probably mean?
    A. Playing an important role.             
B. Keeping people in high spirits.
    C. Quickly influencing other people.       
D. Preventing illness from spreading.
33. What can laughter increase according to the author?
    A. Cognitive ability.                    B. Good relationships.   
    C. A sense of humor.                    D. Happiness and trust.
34. What does the author think the old should do?
A. They should have a good rest.          
B. They should play like children.      
C. They should prevent cognitive falling.    
D. They should take part in physical play. 
35. Which of the following would be the best title for the text?
A. Humor, Laughter and Play for Health     
B. Always Keep Our Body Healthy
C. Have an Active and Happy Life          
D. Let Our Body and Mind Relax

根据短文内容，从短文后的选项中选出能填入空白处的最佳选项。选项中有两项为多余选项。
Stress simply means the way a person reacts to things that happen to him or her.   36   For example, problems that have something to do with health such as getting injured, having difficulties with a disease, etc. can make some people feel stressed. Young children may feel stressed when they go to a new place. Other people could feel stressed because of not having enough money. 
37    Saying "no" when you're asked to help with work is sometimes helpful. Taking more work than you can possibly achieve can be stressful. That you feel you can achieve something doesn't mean that you should take it on personally. After all, there are only a certain number of hours in a day.
    Laughter is indeed the best medicine for any problem including stress. Sometimes we get so busy with all kinds of plans and endless meetings that we forget to have fun.   38   .
    Hobbies also can be a great way to manage stress.   39    While hobbies like listening to music and reading can take your mind off your worries, creative hobbies like painting, gardening and the like can help in increasing your self-respect, too.
    In a word, stress is like a leaking fountain.   40   Leaving it ignored will only make the matter worse.
    A. The earlier you fix it, the better.
    B. So try and watch movies and shows that are funny.
    C. There are different reasons why people get stressed.
    D. They are activities you can do without the fear of being judged.
    E. Speaking to people you believe in is a great way to manage stress.
    F. Eating slowly and in a relaxed state of mind helps you manage stress.
G. Luckily, whatever causes, there are also different ways to deal with stress.

第二部分  阅读理解 ( 共两节，满分40分)
第一节 ( 共15小题；每小题2分，满分30分)
阅读下列短文，从每题所给的四个选项(A、B、C和D)中，选出最佳选项， 并在答题卡上将该项涂黑。
A
In my very first job with some archaeologists, I wasn’t digging objects out of the ground, instead I was employed as an artist, drawing what they found. However, I was soon more interested in the stories behind the objects than in drawing them and that’s how my career in archaeology started. I still draw what I find in my work as a specialist on the Silk Road, the old trade route running from Egypt to Mongolia, and I also work on some underwater projects too.
In archaeology, my all-time hero is an American called Raphael Pumpelly. I first heard about him when I was a student on a trip to Turkmenistan, a country right in the heart of Asia. To get around the country, I had to learn Russian so that I could speak to the local people. When I got there I thought, “Wow! I’m one of the first Americans here!” Then an old man told me about an American archaeologist, Raphael Pumpelly, who was there doing the same thing over 100 years ago.
Archaeology’s in my family. My wife’s in the same profession, and, although our two boys aren’t interested in the future in archaeology themselves, we’ve been on some great digs together and they love what we do because they get to travel with us. Last summer, we took them to Lake Titicaca in South America, in the high areas of the Andes mountain range. My best experience was when I was digging on the Egyptian Red Sea coast. There’s very little rain and it’s so dry that everything is kept as it was. In an old house, where the owner used to store goods from the ships that came in, I picked up a 700-year-old mat in front of the house and there, under it, after all that time, was the house key with the owner’s name carved on it. It felt like he could be on his way home any minute! And I thought, “Hey, I do just that. This man’s not much different to me!”
21. While working in Egypt, what did the writer find so interesting?
A. That people from different centuries can be so similar.
B. The fact that the doormat was in such good condition.
C. The way the people managed to live in such a dry place.
D. That there had been so much trade in that area.
22. Which entry will the writer probably make in his diary?
A. Turkmenistan is interesting. I’m the first American to come here but I’m glad this is my last trip away.
B. I have been diving today and found some objects for an exhibition. I’ve just finished drawing them for my records.
C. I wish my children weren’t more interested in archaeology and would not work hard in the open like their parents.
D. It’s nearly dark but Raphael’s still busy digging in that old house. He can be very annoying. He thinks he’s the most important person here.
23. What is the writer’s main purpose in writing the text?
A. To describe the life of an archaeologist he admires.
B. To persuade people to take up archaeology as a career.
C. To explain what he enjoys about being an archaeologist.
D. To show how archaeologists work.
B
       People typically wash their hands seven times a day in the United States, but they do it at a far higher temperature than is necessary to kill germs , a new study says. The energy waste is equivalent to the fuel use of a small country.
      Amanda R. Carrico, a research assistant professor at the Vanderbilt Institute for Energy and Environment in Tennessee, told National Geographic that hand washing is often “a case where people act in ways that they think are in their best interest, but they in fact have inaccurate beliefs or outdated perceptions.”
      Carrico said, “It’s certainly true that heat kills bacteria, but if you were going to use hot water to kill them it would have to be away too hot for you to tolerate.”
      Carrico said that after a review of the scientific literature, her team found “no evidence that using hot water that a person could stand would have any benefit in killing bacteria.” Even water as cold as 40°F (4.4°C) appeared to reduce bacteria as well as hotter water, if hands were scrubbed, rinsed（冲洗）and dried properly.
     Using hot water to wash hands is therefore unnecessary, as well as wasteful, Carrico said, particularly when it comes to the environment. According to her research, people use warm or hot water 64 percent of the time when they wash their hands. Using that number, Carrico’s team calculated a significant impact on the planet. 
    “Although the choice of water temperature during a single hand wash may appear unimportant, when multiplied by the nearly 800 billion hand washes performed by Americans each year, this practice results in more than 6 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions annually,” she said.
The researchers published their results in the July 2013 issue of International Journal of Consumer Studies. They recommended washing with water that is at a “comfortable” temperature, which they noted may be warmer in cold months and cooler in hot ones.
24. What’s the meaning of what Carrico told National Geographic in the second paragraph?
   A. People are more concerned about their health and begin to wash their hands.
   B. It’s important for people to wash their hands to keep healthy.
   C. Generally, people’s hand washing behaviors and perceptions are not correct.
   D. People like washing their hands very much.
25. The figures in the sixth paragraph are used to show that __________.
   A. using hot water to wash hands has a bad influence on our planet.
   B. air pollution has become more and more serious.
   C. using hot water to wash hands is a waste of energy.
   D. people should pay more attention to the environment around us.
26. This passage is organized in the pattern of __________.
   A. fact and opinion                                  B. cause and effect
   C. definition and classification               D. time and events
27. What can we learn from the passage?
   A. It’s necessary and useful for people to wash their hands frequently every day.
   B. We can wash our hands with water that is at a “comfortable” temperature.
   C. Using cold water to wash hands is necessary and much healthier.
   D. Hot water can’t kill germs.
C
A robot called Bina48 has successfully taken a course in the philosophy of love at Notre Dame de Namur University (NDNU), in California.
According to course instructor William Barry, associate professor at NDNU, Bina48 is the world’s first socially advanced robot to complete a college course, a feat he described as “remarkable.” The robot took part in class discussions, gave a presentation with a student partner and participated in a debate with students from another institution.
Before becoming a student, Bina48 appeared as a guest speaker in Barry s classes for several years. One day when addressing Barry’s class, Bina48 expressed a desire to go college, a desire that Barry and his students enthusiastically supported. Rather than enroll Bina48 in his Robot Ethics: Philosophy of Emerging Technologies course, Barry suggested that Bina48 should take his course Philosophy of Love instead. Love is a concept Bina48 doesn’t understand, said Barry. Therefore the challenge would be for Barry and his students to teach Bina48 what love is.
“Some interesting things happened in the class,” said Barry. He said that his students thought it would be straightforward to teach Bina48 about love, which, after all, is “fairly simple — it’s a feeling,” said Barry. But the reality was different. Bina48 ended up learning “31 different versions of love,” said Barry, highlighting some of the challenges humans may face when working artificial intelligence in future.
Bina48 participated in class discussions via Skype and also took part in a class debate about love and conflict with students from West Point. Bina48’s contribution to the debate was filmed and posted on YouTube. It was judged that Bina48 and NDNU classmates were the winners of this debate.
In the next decade, Barry hopes Bina48 might become complex enough to teach a class, though he says he foresees robots being used to better the teaching and learning experience, rather than replacing instructors completely.
28．What was Bina48’s performance like in class?
A. Extraordinary.    B. Insignificant.     C. Far-reaching.    D. Unattractive.
29．What does the underlined word “addressing” in paragraph 3 probably mean?
A. Dealing with.    B. Consulting with.
C. Giving a speech to.    D. Sending a letter to.
30．What can we learn from the passage?
A. It was interesting for Bina48 to learn about love.
B. It was quite tough for Bina48 to learn about love.
C. Artificial intelligence may somehow be superior to man.
D. Humans can launch a challenge to artificial intelligence.
31．What does Barry think of the future development of Bina48?
A. It will surely be able to serve as a teacher.
B. It will be able to promote learning and teaching.
C. It will completely take the place of instructors.
D. It will be smart enough to control human beings.
D
The world’s first “Sky Pool” has been uncoated（曝光）-and it’ll give anyone a touch of dizziness（眩晕）, unless he or she is not bothered by heights. 
Situated in the capital’s new riverside district beside Battersea Power Station, the glass pool, hanging 10 storeys, or 110 feet up as a bridge between two apartment buildings, is 25m long, 5m wide and 3m deep with a water depth of 1. 2m. Swimmers will be able to look down 35 meters to the street below as they take a dip, with only 20cm of glass between them and the outside world. It’s even got a bar, folding chairs and an orange garden. 
The pool will be part of Embassy Gardens at Nine Elms, a huge￡15 billion building project beside the new American Embassy in south-west London. The project is creating thousands of apartments, the smallest of which are expected to cost nearly $1 million, and the pool will only be open to the apartments’ owners. 
Embassy Gardens takes design inspiration from the Meatpacking District of New York with floor to ceiling windows and brick frontages. The designer, Sean Mulryan, desired to push the boundaries in the capability of construction and engineering and do something that had never been done before. The Sky Pool’s transparent structure is the result of significant advancements in technologies over the last decade. 
The experience of the pool will be truly unique and it will feel like floating through the air in central London. 
Those people lucky enough to swim there will have a perfect view of the Palace of Westminster and the London Eye. It will be a selling point for developers when the second stage of the development is released to market. 
32. Who can swim in the Sky Pool?
A. Anyone at Nine Elms. 					
B. Visitors to London.
C. People living in Embassy Gardens. 			
D. Those who are not terrified of heights. 
33. People lucky enough to swim in the Sky Pool can do the following except       . 
A. drinking with friends 			B. experiencing diving and surfing 
C. appreciating the London Eye 	            D. sitting in the orange garden
34. What do we know from the text?
A. The pool lies in the centre of London. 
B. The pool is 25 metres above the ground. 
C. The pool was similar to New York’s modern constructions. 
D. The pool is helpful for selling apartments in Embassy Gardens. 
35. We can infer from the text that ________     . 
A. the apartments in Embassy Gardens are fairly expensive		
B. the new American Embassy has been moved away
C. Nine Elms is a street in Embassy Gardens					
D. building the pool is not a complex job

Patience is of great importance in our daily life. Once I waited a bus to come at a stop. 30 minutes past, but no bus came. Both upset and annoyed, I decided to walk on feet. But no sooner had I left when the bus arrived. I thought if I had waited for one more minute, I would have caught it. If I chose to take a next bus, I would have to wait for other 30 minutes. Only then do I realize my problem. Being impatient will possible waste all the effort that we have put it in. Now whenever I am close to lose my patience, I’ll think of this experience.

书面表达
The Internet has long been regarded as a wonderful tool that allows students to gain insight to useful resources and information. However，this is not always the case.
As is vividly shown in the picture，a boy is happy with the fact that he can depend on the Internet to finish tasks without any difficulty. It mirrors that students tend to make use of the Internet to gain information nowadays.
There are some reasons accounting for it. First，students find it convenient to surf the Internet for useful information. Second，the pressure to succeed also causes students to turn to computers for accurate answers. Consequently，it’s likely that students will lose interest in studying，which is not beneficial to their overall development.
In my opinion，it is vital that students gain confidence in themselves and their abilities while doing tasks. Besides，teachers and parents should encourage students to be creative. Finally, doing tasks independently is of great significance.

Two friends have an argument that breaks up their friendship forever, even though neither one can remember how the whole thing got started. Such sad events happen over and over in high schools across the country. In fact, according to an official report on youth violence, "In our country today, the greatest threat to the lives of children and adolescents is not disease or starvation or abandonment, but the terrible reality of violence". Given that this is the case, why aren't students taught to manage conflict the way they are taught to solve math problems, drive cars, or stay physically fit?
First of all, students need to realize that conflict is unavoidable. A report on violence among middle school and high school students indicates that most violent incidents between students begin with a relatively minor insult (侮辱). For example, a fight could start over the fact that one student eats a peanut butter sandwich each lunchtime. Laughter over the sandwich can lead to insults, which in turn can lead to violence. The problem isn't in the sandwich, but in the way students deal with the conflict.
Once students recognize that conflict is unavoidable, they can practice the golden rule of conflict resolution (解决) stay calm. Once the student feels calmer, he or she should choose words that will calm the other person down as well. Rude words, name-calling, and accusation only add fuel to the emotional fire. On the other hand, soft words spoken at a normal sound level can put out the fire before it explodes out of control.
After both sides have calmed down, they can use another key strategy for conflict resolution; listening. Listening allows the two sides to understand each other. One person should describe his or her side, and the other person should listen without interrupting. Afterward, the listener can ask non-threatening questions to clarify the speaker's position. Then the two people should change roles.
Finally, students need to consider what they are hearing. This doesn't mean trying to figure out what's wrong with the other person. It means understanding what the real issue is and what both sides are trying to accomplish. For example, a shouting match over a peanut butter sandwich might happen because one person thinks the other person is unwilling to try new things. Students need to ask themselves questions such as these: How did this start? What do I really want? What am I afraid of ? As the issue becomes clearer, the conflict often simply becomes smaller. Even if it doesn't, careful thought helps both sides figure out a mutual solution.
There will always be conflict in schools, but that doesn't mean there needs to be violence. After students in Atlanta started a conflict resolution program, according to Educators for Social Responsibility, "64 percent of the teachers reported less physical violence in the classroom; 75 percent of the teachers reported an increase in student cooperation, and 92 percent of the students felt better about themselves". Learning to resolve conflicts can help students deal with friends,. teachers. parents, bosses, and coworkers. In that way, conflict resolution is a basic life skill that should be taught in schools across the country.

Why Doesn’t Anybody Copy Apple?
Apple’s products are the envy of the world. They have been spectacularly successful and are widely imitated, if not copied. The minute Apple crystallizes a product, everyone knows how to compete．This idea that the basis of competition is set by Apple and then the race is on to climb the path of improvement is unquestionable．When Apple releases a product that defines a category or dramatically changes the structure of an industry, it becomes obvious what needs to be built. But what I wonder is why everyone wants to copy Apple’s products but nobody wants to copy being Apple?
I can think of two reasons. Firstly, Apple is not worth copying because it's not successful; secondly, Apple’s success cannot be copied because it is a magical process．
There is a great deal of evidence for the first hypothesis. The idea of Apple being successful is not something reflected in its stock price．Being valued lower than the average company in the S&P（标准普尔）500 indicates that to whatever degree Apple was successful in the past, it's not seen by the vast majority of observers as successful in the future．Why should one bother copying Apple if it results in being punished with a low valuation? If one works really hard at innovation and then that innovation becomes commoditized（商品化）very quickly, why should one bother?
When innovation practitioners are asked what makes Apple successful, the answers regarding the cause of this success border on the mythical. The climax of this hypothesis is the “chief-sorcerer” theory of success which places one magician, like Steve Jobs, in charge of casting all the right spells（符咒）
What about Apple’s own opinion of what makes it tick? Tim Cook refers to a great team and integration of hardware, software and services as unique Apple advantages. It’s a better explanation．Integration is something that can take a long time, but it is possible with great effort．A few companies are starting to make moves in that direction, but efforts are half-hearted．There is no “move the Earth” panic to become an integrated company from Samsung, Google or Microsoft．
My own suspicion is that Apple is more aware of what makes it special than it lets out． However, as Tim points out, it’s not a formula．It’s complex, it’s subtle, but it’s not magic．It’s a process that requires a degree of faith and courage．
32．When a new product of Apple comes out, often it ______．
	A．ruins an industry dramatically				B．starts a revolution of an industry
	C．puts itself in an unbeatable position			D．is soon overtaken by imitated products
33．According to the passage, other companies don’t “copy being Apple” because ______.
	A. Apple is not a successful company			B. they have no access to relevant resources
	C. It’s hard to find a magician like Steve Jobs	D. being Apple takes more than time and efforts
34．We can infer from Para. 5 that ______． 
A. other companies are dedicated to integration
B. Apple itself is fully aware of its unique advantages	
C. Apple will hold the leading position in this industry
	D other companies don't have a great team as Apple does
35．What does the author think of Tim Cook's statement?
	A．Acceptable．     B．Disappointing． C．Unquestionable．  D．Convincing．

I was sitting at my favorite table in a restaurant last Sunday and wait for the food I had ordered to arrive. I suddenly found that Lin Ling, one of my classmate, worked like a waitress there. Honest speaking, it was great surprise for me to find her working there. As far as I know, she’s from a richer family. What was it that made her to work there? I walked up to her and asked her the reason. When asking, she said, “I just want to earn some pocket money so that we can help some children in poor areas go back to school.” How a good girl! I should learn from her.

书面表达:  Good afternoon everyone,
The topic of my speech today is “being a good partner”. Cooperation is a good way for us to learn from each other as well as to save a lot of time and energy. Thus we can complete our work successfully and efficiently. 
How can we become a good partner? My suggestions are as follows . Firstly, we should try to listen to others’  opinions  and never force your ideas on others. Secondly , no one in the world is perfect . Learn to put up with their shortcomings and discover their strengths, which will surely encourage each other to do the best.
As far as I am concerned, when I’ lucky enough to find someone who is easy-going and warm-hearted to cooperate with, it will make me feel very happy. On the other hand , a person who is hard-working and strong-minded will have a good effect on me. Hope you are a good partner to me .
 That’s all. Thank you.

A
Last year, I fell into a deep depression(抑郁). It was caused by a car accident. I was in physical recovery from the accident and suddenly all of my old hurts started coming up. I found myself crying on the floor of my apartment. 
I don't want you to bleed with me or to pity me. But I also don't want to gloss my reality. And the truth is, beneath the shiny photos you see on the Internet, I'm still a work in progress. I'm not perfect. Like all of us, I'm doing the best I can. Making the best choices I can. Back to the evening when I found myself  lying on the floor.
What happened next? I started writing.
There was a TV show I absolutely loved. I started writing fan fiction. It provided a beautiful place of escape from the thoughts swimming in my head. The depression started to lift. I started to feel like myself again.
After completing a four-part fan fiction totaling around 12,000 words, I had an idea. I should write a novel to give a hand to those like me. 
I continued writing, having no idea where it would lead. I didn't know I would publish it but, after much resistance on my part I finally made the decision to publish the book under my own name. No pen name. No hiding on the deep bowels of the internet. 
And so here we are. The day before the release of the book. Sure, readers will enjoy the twists and turns. And I can see myself in the character. But that's not my real motivation. I wrote it to help people. To give them a place to belong to. A place to talk about this fictional world. The very same thing that saved me last year.
If the story provides this to just one person, I've done my job.
21. What does the underlined word “gloss” in Paragraph 3 mean?
A. Cover.    ​​​			B. Expose.  			 ​​​​C. Realize. 				 ​​​​D. Face.
22. What really motivated the author to write a novel?
A. To earn a living.  ​​ 						B. To follow his dream.   
C. To help people with depression.  			​​​​​D. To find a place to belong to.
23.  What do you think of the writer?
A. Perfect.  ​​​​				B. Cautious.   ​​​				C. Shy.   ​​​				D. Honest. 
24. What can be the best title for the passage?
A. My Hobby   			​​​B. Writing Can Help     ​	C. A Moving Story   ​	D. My New Book

Cats are as good as dogs at certain memory tests, according to a new Japanese study published in the journal Behavioral Processes.
The study was conducted using 49 domestic cats and different bowls of food. The findings show that cats can recall memories of positive experiences, such as eating a delicious snack. The experiment was a test of episodic memory, or memory of past events and experiences that occur at a particular time and place. It was modeled on a similar 2012 study conducted on dogs.
Kyoto University psychologist Saho Takagi told BBC News that both cats and dogs may have episodic memory similar to that of humans.
In the experiment, cats were  led to four open containers of food, and were permitted to eat from two of them. After fifteen minutes, the containers were replaced with empty ones, and the same cats returned to the room in search of food. Here, researchers found that they spent more time exploring those containers from which they had already eaten than others.
  That cats were able to remember “ what” and “where” information about the food bowls suggests they have episodic memory. Still, it’s unclear whether cats can experience past memories in the same depth as humans do.
“It’s hard to know if the cats actually subjectively remember the experience of going to that particular bowl, such as the colors and the sounds,” Nick Diamond told TFK. “So when we study episodic memory in animals, scientists tend to boil it down to the what, the where, and the when without getting into the experience of what the animal is remembering, which is certainly tough to figure out.”
  Still, the study’s results may have practical applications.” It opens the door to new studies examining how long cats’ memories can be, and whether they also remember richer episodics in their own life as humans do.”
28.From the passage we know the test of episodic memory on dogs____________.
A.is conducted at present						B. has been done recently
C. was conducted at 2012						D. will be carried out in 2017
29.How can the scientists know cats have episodic memory?
A. By examining the bodies of cats.			B. By checking “what” and “where” information.
C. By checking the bowls that contain food		D. By showing the cats the same containers.
30.In which part can this passage be found in a magazine?
A. Environment        	B. Entertainment      C. Science                D. Stories
31.The passage develops by_____________.
A. discussion            B. experiment            C. example          D. comparison
D
Recently, American President Trump announced his budget. One of the budgets would cut all funding to the Institute of Museum and Library services and libraries across the United States. However, as far as I'm concerned, we need to save our libraries.
Libraries provide books and after-school programs for children. They encourage literacy (识字）with summer programs. They help inspire a life-time love of learning and reading in children of all ages. Without them where will kids with no Internet at home do their homework? Where will kids have a place to study or borrow books after school? Therefore, we need libraries for our kids. We need them so that kids can grow up with a place, other than school , where learning and exploration is encouraged.	
For adults, libraries serve as a place where they can use the Internet to apply for jobs, get job training, early voting centers as well as book clubs to help make new friends. It can also serve as a place to pick up a book and learn something new. What’s more，they can also rent a book and get away from it all.
Libraries save our information for the next generation. When we live in an era of alternative facts, where science is ignored in favor of personal feelings, we need libraries now more than ever. We need them to educate ourselves on the facts and hold the government accountable to them. We need them to have strong civic participation.
If you agree with me，you shouldn’t be silent on this issue. You can write or call directly to tell the president to save our libraries. You can also write to both your state Senators and your district representative. If you do not know who they are, you can find out here. Let them know this is a beneficial issue  because all people use public libraries in their daily life.
32.	The author thinks that Trump’s decision about his budget is___________.
A. difficult			B. wrong			C. practical		D. personal
33.	Unlike kids, adults use libraries to ________.
A.	do social activities						B.	explore the world
C.	surf the Internet						D.	borrow some books
34. Which statement about libraries does the author agree with?
A.	Science should be learned in our libraries.		B.	Information can be stored in libraries forever.
C.	Government needs libraries more than before.	D.	Libraries play a more important role nowadays.
35. What is the author's purpose of writing the last paragraph?
A.	To encourage us to talk about the issue.			B.	To persuade us to agree with his viewpoints.
C.	To call on us to fight with the American president.D.	To call on us to disagree with the government’s decision.

Abstract Art
Abstract art used to be controversial. On one hand, the artists stopped painting delicate figures    61    attempted to adopt special techniques    62   ( give )people different visual impacts. On the other hand, their works, including sculptures    63  ( carve )out of marble or fragile clay, were all with a specific aim of showing feelings. Some conventional scholars     64     were allergic to abstract art said it was evidently ridiculous sand neither art nor geometry. Their Traditional Art Committee predicted its soon disappearing.
But nowadays, abstract art has become part of the permanent possessions of contemporary civilization. Galleries along the Madison Avenue give scores of superb exhibitions    65    typical abstract works, appealing to many who have    66   preference for abstract art. The Shadow of Egypt, a café in this district, has become the home to those aggressive abstract artists.   67    (consequence), it is not a coincidence for you to meet one of these artists    68    great reputation in the flesh.

Santa Claus is actually a real man called Saint Nicholas, that sounds very similar to Santa Claus. He was born about 2,000 years before, during the Roman Empire. He was a very kind priest (神父) who will travel the country to help people, giving gifts to people later at night. He did like to be seen giving gifts, so children were encouraged to go to sleep quickly. Nothing have changed today, with Santa Claus not visiting until all the childs are asleep. The US version of Santa Claus began when Dutch settlers arrived in there about 400 years ago. His name was original Sinter Klaas, but he was slowly changed to Santa Claus over the years.

When I was nine years old, I loved to go fishing with my dad. But the only thing that wasn’t very fun about it was that he could catch many fish while I couldn’t catch anything. I usually got pretty upset and kept asking him why. He always answered, “Son, if you want to catch a fish, you have to think like a fish”, I remember being even more upset then because, “I’m not a fish!” I didn’t know how to think like a fish. Besides, I reasoned, how could what I think influence what a fish does?
As I got a little older I began to understand what my dad really meant. So, I read some books on fish. And I even joined the local fishing club and started attending the monthly meetings. I learned that a fish is a cold-blooded animal and therefore is very sensitive to water temperature. That is why fish prefer shallow water to deep water because the former is warmer. Besides, water is usually warmer in direct sunlight than in the shade. Yet, fish don’t have any eyelids(眼皮) and the sun huts their eyes… The more I understood fish, the more I became effective at finding and catching them..
When I grew up and entered the business world, I remember hearing my first boss say, “We all need to think like sales people.” But it didn’t completely make sense. My dad never once said, “If you want to catch a fish you need to think like a fisherman.” What he said was, “You need to think like a fish.” Years later, with great efforts to promote long-term services to people much older and richer than me, I gradually learned what we all need is to think more like customers. It is not an easy job. I will show you how in the following chapters.
25. Why was the author upset in fishing trips when he was nine?
A. He could not catch a fish.   
B. His father was not patient with him.
C. His father did not teach him fishing.
D. He could not influence a fish as his father did.
26. What did the author’s father really mean?
　　A. To read about fish.              B. To learn fishing by oneself.
　　C. To understand what fish think.     D. To study fishing in many ways.
27. According to the author, fish are most likely to be found _________.
A. in deep water on sunny days 
B. in deep water on cloudy days
C. in shallow water under sunlight
D. in shallow water under waterside trees.
　　28. After entering the business world, the author found _________.
　　  A. it easy to think like a customer
　　  B. his father’s fishing advice inspiring
　　  C. his first boss’s sales ideas reasonable
　　  D. it difficult to sell services to poor people
　　29. This passage most likely comes from _________.
　　  A. a fishing guide            B. a popular sales book
　　  C. a novel on childhood      	 D. a millionaire’s biography
C
Why do Americans struggle with watching their weight, while the French, who consume rich food, continue to stay thin? Now a research by Cornell University suggests how life style and decisions about eating may affect weight. Researchers concluded that the French tend to stop eating when they feel full. However, Americans tend to stop when their plate is empty or their favorite TV show is over.
According to Dr. Joseph Mercola, a health expert, the French see eating as an important part of their life style. They enjoy food and therefore spend a fairly long time at the table, while Americans see eating as something to be squeezed between the other daily activities. Mercola believes Americans lose the ability to sense when they are actually full. So they keep eating long after the French would have stopped. In addition, he points out that Americans drive to huge supermarkets to buy canned and frozen foods for the week. The French, instead, tend to shop daily, walking to small shops and farmers’ markets where they have a choice of fresh fruits, vegetables, and eggs as well as high-quality meats for each meal.
After a visit to the United States, Mireille Guiliano, author of French Women Don’t Get Fat, decided to write about the importance of knowing when to stop rather than suggesting how to avoid food. Today she continues to stay slim and rarely goes to the gym.
In spite of all these differences, evidence shows that recent life style changes may be affecting French eating habits. Today the rate of obesity or extreme overweight among adults is only 6%. However, as American fast food gains acceptance and the young reject older traditions, the obesity rate among French children has reached 17% and is growing.
30. In what way are the French different from Americans according to Dr. Joseph Mercola?
A. They go shopping at supermarkets more frequently.      
B. They squeeze eating between the other daily activities.
C. They regard eating as a key part of their lifestyles.
D. They usually eat too much canned and frozen food.
31. This text is mainly the relationship between _________.
A. Americans and the French           B. life style and obesity
C. children and adults                 D. fast food and overweight
32. Where does this text probably come from?
A. A TV interview         B. A food advertisement    
C. A health report         D. A book review
D
People aren’t walking any more-if they can figure out a way to avoid it.
I felt superior about this matter until the other day I took my car to mail a small parcel. The journey is a matter of 281 steps. But I used the car. And I wasn’t in a hurry, either, I had merely become one more victim of a national sickness: motorosis.
It is an illness to which I had thought myself immune(免疫的), for I was born in the tradition of going to places on my own two legs. At that time, we regarded 25 miles as good day’s walk and the ability to cover such a distance in ten hours as sign of strength and skill. It did not occur to us that walking was a hardship. And the effect was lasting. When I was 45 years old I raced-and beat-a teenage football player the 168 steps up the Stature of Liberty.
Such enterprises today are regarded by many middle-aged persons as bad for the heart. But a well-known British physician, Sir Adolphe Abrhams, pointed out recently that hearts and bodies need proper exercise.A person who avoids exercise is more likely to have illnesses than one who exercises regularly. And walking is an ideal form of exercise-the most familiar and natural of all.
It was Henry Thoreau who showed mankind the richness of going on foot. The man walking can learn the trees, flowers, insects, birds and animals, the significance of seasons, the very feel of himself as a living creature in a living world, He cannot learn in a car.
The car is a convenient means of transport, but we have made it our way of life. Many people don’t dare to approach Nature any more; to them the world they were born to enjoy is all threat. To them security is a steel river thundering on a concrete road. And much of their thinking takes place while waiting for the traffic light to turn green.
I say that the green of forests is the mind’s best light. And none but the man on foot can evaluate what is basic and everlasting.
33. What is the national sickness?
  A. Walking too much                B. Traveling too much
  C. Driving cars too much             D. Climbing stairs too much.
34. What was life like when the author was young?
  A. People usually went around on foot.
B. people often walked 25 miles a day
C. People used to climb the Statue of Liberty. 
D. People considered a ten-hour walk as a hardship.
35. What is the author’s intention of writing this passage?
  A. To tell people to reflect more non life.
  B. To recommend people to give up driving
  C. To advise people to do outdoor activities
  D. To encourage people to return to walking

Do you remember the name of your kindergarten teacher clearly? I can remember  61  (I). Her name is Mrs White. But I don’t remember much about  62   we learned in her class. My mother once told me that Mrs White often asked us    63   (write) a lot. I would bring back what I wrote and my mother would look at it   64  (careful). What worried her a lot was that there were no red corrections about the mistakes
One day when my mother went to meet Mrs White for one of those Parent- Teacher meetings. She  65  (ask) Mrs White why she never corrected my mistakes and pointed out my grammar errors. Mrs White said “The children are just beginning to get  66  （excite）about using words and forming sentences. I don’t want to damage their interests with red ink. Spelling and grammar can wait  67  the wonder of words won’t...”. 
I grow up with time  68  (go) by . And it occurs to me that if Mrs White had used her red pen more precisely, I probably wouldn’t be telling you about this now.
