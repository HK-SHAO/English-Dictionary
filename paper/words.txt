passed He gave up flying and began sailing He enjoyed it greatly Chichester was already years old when he won the first solo transatlantic sailing race His old dream of going round the world came back but this time he would sail His friends and doctors did not think he could do it as he had lung cancer But Chichester was determined to carry out his plan In August at the age of nearly an age when many men retire he began the greatest voyage of his life Chichester covered miles before stopping in Sydney Australia This was more than twice the distance anyone had previously sailed alone He arrived in Australia on December just days out from England He received a warm welcome from the Australians and from his family who had flown there to meet him On shore Chichester could not walk without help Everybody said the same thing he had done enough he must not go any further But he did not listen After resting in Sydney for a few weeks Chichester set off once more in spite of his friends attempts to dissuade him The second half of his voyage was by far the more dangerous part during which he sailed round the treacherous Cape Horn After succeeding in sailing round Cape Horn Chichester sent the following radio message to London I feel as if I had wakened from a nightmare Wild horses could not drag me down to Cape Horn and that sinister Southern Ocean again Just before o clock on Sunday evening May he arrived back in England where a quarter of a million people were waiting to welcome him Queen Elizabeth II knighted him with the very sword that Queen Elizabeth I had used almost years earlier to knight Sir Francis Drake after he had sailed round the world for the first time The whole voyage from England and back had covered miles It had taken him nine months of which the sailing time was days He had done what he wanted to accomplish What can we learn about Chichester A He failed the solo transatlantic sailing race in B He was a brave and determined man C The

She called on the English to learn form him B She was waiting to congratulate on his success in sailing C She thought poorly of his achievements D She knighted him for praising him We can infer from the text that A Anyone who had sailed alone traveled less than miles before B Chichester sailed round the Atlantic in C Most of the English retire at the age of D Chichester died of lung cancer in after he went back to England B Banquets are usually held in restaurants in private rooms that have been reserved for the purpose You will be met at the door and led to the banquet room Traditionally the head of your delegation should enter the room first Do not be surprised if your hosts greet you with a loud round of applause The proper response is to applaud back Seating arrangements are stricter than in the West Guests should never assume that they may sit where they please and should wait for hosts to guide them to their places Traditionally the Chinese regard the right side as the superior and the left side as the inferior Therefore on formal occasions the host invariably arranges for the main guests to sit on his right side It is the host s responsibility to serve the guests and at very formal banquets people do not begin to eat until the host has served a portion to the principal guest Or the host may simply raise his chopsticks and announce that eating has begun After this point one may serve oneself any food in any amount Remember to go slow on eating Don t fill yourself up when five courses are left to go To stop eating in the middle of a banquet is rude and your host may incorrectly think that something has been done to offend you Drinking takes an important place in Chinese banquets It is likely that the host will stand and hold his glass out with both hands while saying a few words When he says the words gan bei which means bottoms up all present should drain their glasses After this initial toast drinking and toasting are open to all No words are needed to make a toast and it is not necessary to drain your glass although to do so is more respectful When filling another glass it is polite to fill it as full as you can This symbolizes full respect and friendship When the last dish is finished the banquet has officially ended There is little ceremony involved with its conclusion The host may ask if you have eaten your fill Then the principal host will rise signaling that the banquet has ended Generally the principal host will bid good evening to everyone at the door and stay behind to settle the bill with the restaurateur Other hosts usually accompany guests to their vehicles and remain outside waving until the cars have left the premises To attend a formal banquet you A may enter the banquet room directly when you arrive B may stop eating in the middle of the banquet C may help yourself to any food immediately the dishes are served D should applaud back when greeted with a loud round of applause What is the host s responsibility in the author s eyes A Announcing that eating ends B Driving guests to their home C Filling the guests glasses D Arranging for guests to go to their place We can conclude form the passage that A To stop eating halfway means that the dishes taste bad B Guests should drain their g ass es the instant they are filled C Important guests are arranged to sit on the host s right side D The more you drink the more you respect the host The passage mainly tells us A Chinese food is delicious B customs and traditions at banquets in China C what food guests should eat at banquets D different customs between China and western countries C A machine that takes sweat laden clothes and turns the moisture into drinking water is in use in Sweden The device spins and heats the material to remove the sweat and then passes the vapor through a special membrane designed to only let water molecules get through Since its Monday launch its creators say more than people have drunk other s sweat in Gothenburg They add the liquid is cleaner than local tap water The device was built for the United Nation s child focused charity UNICEF to promote a campaign highlighting the fact that million people in the world lack access to clean water The machine was designed and built by engineer Andreas Hammar known locally for his appearances on TV tech show Mekatronik He said the critical part of the sweat machine was a new water purification component developed by a company named HVR in collaboration with Sweden s Royal Institute of Technology It uses a technique called membrane distillation he told the BBC We use a substance that s a bit like Gortex that only lets steam through but keeps bacteria salts clothing fibers and other substances out They have something similar on the International Space Station to treat astronaut s urine but our machine was cheaper to build Volunteers have been sampling the treated sweat since the start of the week in Gothenburg The amount of water it produces depends on how sweaty the person is but one person s T shirt typically produces ml roughly a mouthful The equipment has been put on show at the Gothia Cup the world s largest international youth football tournament MattiasRonge chief executive of Stockholm based advertising agency Deportivo which organized the stunt said the machine had helped raise awareness for UNICEF but in reality had its limitations People haven t produced as much sweat as we hoped right now the weather in Gothenburg is lousy he said So we ve installed exercise bikes alongside the machine and volunteers are cycling like crazy Even so the demand for sweat is greater than the supply And the machine will never be mass produced there are better solutions out there such as water purifying pills Which of the following is the disadvantage of the machine A The water processed by the machine is cleaner than local tap water B The amount of water the machine produces is too small C the machine is cheaper than the similar one on the International Space Station D The machine can help raise awareness of lacking water in the world What is the main idea of the fifth paragraph A How the machine works B Who developed the machine C How the machine was invented D Why the machine was invented What does Mttias Ronge think of the machine A The machine can solve the severe water shortage in the world B People do not like the water the machine processes C The machine should be used in rather hot areas in summer D The machine is not worth popularizing The passage is most likely to be A a tourist brochure B a book review C a news report D a blog D Many people rely on a cup of coffee or two to wake them up in the morning or pick them up during the working day but now a chemist has come up with a speedy alternative to crafting a cup of coffee U S biochemist Ben Yu has created Sprayable Energy which claims to be the world s first caffeine based topical energy spray He said tired workers can spray a shot of caffeine onto their skin without experiencing a strong buzz loading up on unnecessary calories or being stuck with a nasty aftertaste like they might get from drinking energy drinks or coffee The patent pending caffeine spray is an odourless liquid that is absorbed through the skin and distributed through the body over a number of hours to deliver a caffeine hit that apparently lasts longer than guzzling a cup of coffee Each small aluminum bottle of Sprayable Energy contains around sprays the equivalent amount of caffeine to cups of coffee and the creators say it is a much cheaper way of getting a caffeine fix than popping to a cafe The only active ingredient in the spray is caffeine which can naturally enter the human body through the skin by passing through cell membranes as it is very similar to nicotine in structure Each spritz of Sprayable Energy contains around a quarter of the amount of caffeine found in a cup of coffee but apparently has the same effect as a full cup The website said The reason for this is our product not being ingested isn t almost entirely metabolised by the liver before entering your system and becoming available to your body Thus a smaller amount of caffeine can have just the same effect as a very large amount of caffeine ingested through an energy drink or cup of coffee c s website recommends that users apply the spray in places where they normally spritz perfume such as the neck or wrists but warns users not to exceed sprays a day It claims that after spraying the product on the skin users will feel awake and focused without being over stimulated which is common with coffee and energy drinks What can we learn about Sprayable Energy from the passage A A bottle of Sprayable Energyis cheaper than cups of coffee B Sprayable Energy lets users not worry about taking in unecessary calories C Sprayable Energy can be used at least sprays a day D The caffeine spray is a colorless liquid that is absorbed through the skin What does the fifth paragraph mainly tell us A Sprayable Energy is taken by mouth B Before Sprayable Energy is absorbed by body the liver entirely metabolizes it C How Sprayable Energy acts on user s body and how users use the product D Sprayable Energy is convenient but expensive We can conclude from the passage that A Sprayable Energy can not be permitted to be used by people now B Sprayable Energy has not already gone into mass production C each spritz of Sprayable Energy has the same effect as a full cup of coffee D Sprayable Energy is well received by flagging workers The writer s attitude towards Sprayable Energy A negative B positive C uncertain D indifferent New English Tests Are Better but Harder Scores on English tests are very important to students around the world In order to make sure that they do their best both students and teachers should stay informed of how these tests are changing Clive Roberts is a director at ELS Educational Services one of the companies that trains students in English Mr Roberts says the tests are changing greatly in response to the global growth in the use of English as a lingua franca the common language used among people with different native languages Mr Roberts says English is one of the keys now to international student mobility So for that reason old tests are being revamped to meet the needs of universities and employers worldwide In other words students increasingly need English in order to study and work in other countries So schools and businesses are asking for more accurate tests Mr Roberts says several parts of standardized tests have changed recently Now many tests are given on computers And he says tests measure all four skills of language learning reading listening speaking and writing A lot of are now delivered online all four skills are being tested in some cases by computer in particular speaking and writing skills which are the most difficult to assess on a computer environment Computer testing will reduce the length of time required for testing because the tests adjust to the test taker s ability These computer adaptive tests also increase accuracy in scoring Computer adaptive tests change depending on the test taker s responses They can become more or less difficult during the testing session For this reason the set of correct answers will be different for each test taker Another change to language testing relates to cultural sensitivity The term refers to material on a test that is based on a certain culture or is hard for test takers from different cultures to understand Mr Roberts says test development companies are now hiring people with intercultural communication backgrounds to review test items The companies want to make sure the test does not upset test takers Having negative feelings may affect a student s performance on the test Changes to English proficiency tests make them better at measuring the learners ability However Mr Roberts says the changes may mean the tests are more difficult for some students The tests have become more proficiency oriented The items are being designed in such a way that they test real world proficiency and not simply sort of an artificial environment or a specific set of skills that are taught in a classroom So a lot of authentic texts a lot of authentic listening passages are being used The changes mean students have to be able to understand English the way it is used in everyday life not just in textbooks Another big change is the way in which a student s performance on the tests is measured Mr Roberts says that many tests are measured according to the Common European Frame of Reference CERF scale of language proficiency This measurement Mr Roberts says is similar to the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages ACTFL and the Interagency Language Roundtable ILR guidelines which are used by American universities and government agencies respectively The rating scales and guidelines are designed to show what the learner is able to do in the areas of speaking reading listening and writing Mr Roberts says It gives a description of what they can do with the language and then assigns a numerical value to that particular level Mr Roberts says he believes linking the scores and the scales means the tests provide more useful information about a learner s ability than they did before In addition changes to the tests will encourage schools to teach their students to use English for everyday life and study A Cultural sensitivity B What the tests measure C a lot of new tests are being developed D Difficulties in language testing E Changes in language testing F new tests are being measured by some language experts G Accuracy in language testing A B C D They re going to kick me out

claimed tohave anything to do with baseball In a special commission created by the sportinggoods merchant and former major league player A J Spalding used weak evidence namely the claims of one man mining engineer Abner Graves to come up with the Doubleday origin story Cooperstown businessmen and major league officials would rely on the myth s lasting power in the s when they established the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in the village As it turns out the real history of baseball is a little more complicated than the Doubleday legend References to games resembling baseball in the United States date hack to the th century its most direct ancestors appear to be two English games rounder a a children s game brought to New England by the earliest colonists and cricket By the time of the American Revolution variations of such games were being played on schoolyards and college campuses across the country They became even more popular in newly industrialized cities wheremen sought work in the mid th century In September a group of New York City men founded the New York Knickerbocker Baseball Club One of them would make a new set of rules that would form the basis for

at the local convenience store I don t think many people appreciate what a difficult job these folks have They work for a little over minimum wage and I often wonder how they make ends meet One of the clerks Charlie was always wearing his glasses but he didn t one day I asked him about it and he said they d been out of order and that he couldn t afford a new pair His family needed money It was obvious that he was having a difficult time We wanted to help him so we turned to our own eye doctor for assistance with a plan We had his secretary contact him asking him to come in for an eye exam for free We told the doctor to let him order whatever glasses he wanted and that we would pay for them Although Charlie questioned what was going on the doctor just told him that someone had offered the money for his new glasses When we went in to pay the bill the doctor told us he was so touched by our idea that he waived the exam fee and only charged us for half the price of the glasses It was so wonderful to see Charlie in her new glasses and he enjoyed telling all the regular customers how the gift came about I m sure that upon hearing her story ideas of kindness may have emerged in the

to the fullest extent Fathers and mothers frequently teach their children both ambition and the confidence necessary to work toward their goals American parents are always active in concentrating on what their kids can do not what they can t As a result millions of American boys and girls grow up hoping to become actors and athletes diplomats and doctors Many of them even want to become president American parents often encourage their children to become involved in extra activities of all types at school such as student government sports and music They believe that only through taking part in these activities can their children become mature young adults As we all know schoolwork is important But parents should realize that the social skills their children learn form natural conversations with each other are as important as schoolwork and the skills they will need in the future work What s more important in their work is that their children should have a sound knowledge of physics or the ability to communicate effectively As a rule Chinese parents don t educate their children about the same kind of ambition and confidence as Americans do nor do they encourage the same level of participation in extra activities Children are typically advised to study hard and pass exams They have to spend a lot of time in doing much schoolwork every day It is a great waste of time to do so Now more and more Chinese parents have recognized that they should pay attention to developing the potential of their children I hope that leaders in Chinese educational circles should take some measures to develop the potential of their children I am very confident about it From the passage we know the American parents pay much more attention to A the social skills than Chinese parents B their children s studying hard and well C what their children want but they can t D extra activities than schoolwork According to the passage Chinese parents A know more than American parents to

activities From the passage we can infer A American children are brave and adventurous B American children are more active in their studies C Chinese children have the ability to communicate effectively D Something should be done to develop the potential of the children in China What s the writer s attitude towards Chinese education reform A Neutral B Indifferent C Positive D Negative D Nowadays many people are concerned about the problem of what to do with electronic waste such as old televisions computers radios cellular telephones and other electronic equipment Electronic trash or e waste is piling up faster than ever in American homes and businesses People do not know what to do with old televisions or computers so they throw them in the trash National Solid Waste Management Association NSWMA state programs director Chaz Miller says the large amount of electronic waste Americans product is not unexpected The US Environmental Protection Agency EPA estimates more than million consumer electronic items are dumped each year and there is a push by more states to ban the waste from landfills and create recycling programs They can be torn apart and sorted for useable parts Mike Fannon who runs the plant in Baltimore says There are lots of valuable metals that can be recovered and reused instead of just putting them in the landfill and in certain components there are some materials that should not really be in the landfill Fannon says nearly percent of electronic waste is recycled nationwide Thirteen years ago it was only about percent Recycling rates continue to rise as more communities have banned electronics from landfills in order to keep e waste poisons like lead and mercury out of garbage dumps This year several states like Vermont imposed a ban on electronic waste in landfills More than other states have also adopted bans on e waste in landfills Chaz Miller says more can be done to boost electronic waste recycling We can do much better noted Miller I think clearly our goal should be to do as well as we do recycling newspapers Which of the following does NOT belong to e waste A Old televisions B Old computers C Old cell phones D Old newspapers Why is e waste banned from landfills in many states A Because it can not be recycled B Because the landfills are already full C Because it might damage the environment D Because it can be shipped to other countries According to Mike Fannon what might be the best way of dealing with e waste A Recycling it B Selling it C Burying it D Breaking it What can we learn from the passage A Chaz Miller works for EPA B Miller is optimistic about the future of e waste C At present less than percent of e waste is recycled D All states in the US have banned e waste from landfills Pool Safety Tips for Kids On a hot summer day there are few things that are more appealing than a nice cool pool And it is completely relaxing Of course if you have children there are certain safety measures you should take whether you have a pool in your backyard or are going to a public pool Go swimming together No person should ever swim alone Though many people do the simple truth is that it only takes a second to become injured or drown Having someone there with you can make the difference between life and death This is especially true for young children If your child is under the age of you should never allow them to swim out of arm s length Kids love to chase one another through the water But it is important that you emphasize to your children that at no time should they be running around the pool or pushing anyone In the water teach children not to jump on top of one another and to watch their surroundings so that they do not accidentally knock into others injuring them Playing around in the pool is very interesting but dangerous Keep it locked If you own a pool you must have a locking gate around your pool Keep the gate locked at all times even when you are physically in the pool It is terrible for children to steal into the pool Know the way out Make sure that they know where all ladders are and that you teach them to use them for entering and exiting the pool safely Although your child may be able to lift herself or himself out of the pool using the side that is not the safest way to go Don t play around in the pool Be sure to show all children the proper way to exit the pool Swimming under water is forbidden in the poor This is to prevent children from entering the pool without your permission Slipping into the water seems like the perfect way to deal with the heat Something sad happens every year Make sure kids know food should be eaten either before or after swimming A B C D Many of us have characteristics that come from our families Maybe we have our father s eyes or our grandmother s hair color But there are still other elements of our personalities such as and viewpoints that we pick up by our parents Perhaps we have picked up our mother s love of cleaning or our dad s of humor The researchers at the University of Michigan there are usually three kinds of people from their The first kind of people are the job oriented people who to regard a job as simply a way to make money They to working day after day and don t think it for them to do anything else If you have a job oriented father you may view work this way However you will not hold this viewpoint if you grow up close to your job oriented mother The second are the career oriented people who see their job as a place to gain These are the people who don t working overtime In fact some people love their jobs so much that they are feeling more comfortable in the than at home They are always to make progress in their work Being close to a career oriented father means you ll carry on your father s enough having a mother with this viewpoint seems to have little The third are the calling oriented people who consider their job as a way to have a effect on the world They are more about improving the world around them than earning a large salary In the study those people came from homes where both parents had This suggests that adolescents need the of both parents in order to

Museum a hundred years ago and more people came read them The old reading rooms were crowd The air was bad and readers got terrible headaches The librarian Panizzi wanted poor students as as rich men to be able to learn He got a free copy of every new book for the British Museum Soon there were three rows books on every shelf and hundreds of books on the floor Something cheerful happened Panizzi he designed the famous round Reading Room with a beautiful high roof and forty kilometers of bookshelf Some of the equipment was unusual Cool air came up through small holes in the tables Hot air in tubes under the floor kept readers feet warm When the new Reading Room opened there was a party with drinks a large breakfast on the desks You can imagine wonderful the new Reading Room is Since then many famous men write there And the readers can enjoy all kinds of books comfortable in the new Reading Room Last week when we learned the new word slovenly we asked to make a sentence with it I

alert observer of human character Within seconds of meeting someone he could sum up their strengths and weaknesses It was always a challenge to see if any of my boyfriends could pass Dad s test None did Dad was always right they didn t pass my test either After Dad died I wondered how I d figure it out on my own That s when Jack arrived on the scene He was different from any other guy I d dated He could sit for hours on the piano bench with my mother discussing some composers My brother Rick loudly announced that Jack wasn t a turkey like the other guys I d brought home Jack passed my family

proposal in Paragraph means A offer of marriage B wedding ceremony C celebration of birthday D piece of advice B The extraordinary Eastgate Building in Harare Zimbabwe s capital city is said to be the only one in the world to use the same cooling and heating principles as the termite mound Architect Mick Pearce used precisely the same strategy when designing the Eastgate Building which has no air conditioning and almost no heating The building the country s largest commercial and shopping complex uses less than of the energy of a conventional building of its size The Eastgate s owners saved million on a million building because an air conditioning equipment didn t have to be imported The complex is actually two buildings linked by bridges across a shady glass roofed atrium open to the air Fans suck fresh air in from the atrium blow it upstairs through hollow spaces under the floors and from there into each office through baseboard vents As it rises and warms it is drawn out via ceiling vents and finally exists through forty eight brick chimneys During summer s cool nights big fans blow air through the building seven times an hour to cool the empty floors By day smaller fans blow two changes of air an hour through the building to circulate the air which has been in contact with the cool floors For winter days there are small heaters in the vents This is all possible only because Harare is feet above sea level has cloudless skies little dampness and rapid temperature changes days as warm as commonly drop to at night You couldn t do this in New York with its hot summers and cold winters Pearce said The engineering firm of Ove Arup Partners monitors daily temperatures It is found that the temperature of the building has generally stayed between and with the exception of the annual hot period just before the summer rains in October and three days in November when a doorkeeper accidentally switched off the fans at night And the air is fresh far more so than in air conditioned buildings where up to of the air is recycled Why was Eastgate cheaper to be built than a conventional building A It was designed in a smaller size B No air conditioners were fixed in C Its heating system was less advanced D It used rather different building materials What does it refer to in Paragraph A Hollow space B Baseboard vent C Fresh air from outside D Heat in the building Why would a building like Eastgate Not work efficiently in New York A New York has less clear skies as Harare B Its dampness affects the circulation of air C New York covers a larger area than Harare D Its temperature changes seasonally rather than daily The data in the last paragraph suggests Eastgate s temperature control system A works better in hot seasons B can recycle up to of the air C functions well for most of the year D allows a wide range of temperatures C There is a popular belief among parents that schools are no longer interested in spelling No school I have taught in has ever ignored spelling or considered it unimportant as a basic skill There are however vastly different ideas about how to teach it or how much priority it must be given over in general language development and writing ability The problem is how to encourage a child to express himself freely and confidently in writing without holding him back with the complexities of spelling If spelling becomes the only focal point of his teacher s interest clearly a bright child will be likely to play safe He will tend to write only words within his spelling range choosing to avoid adventurous language That s why teachers often encourage the early use of dictionaries and pay attention to content rather than technical ability I was once shocked to read on the bottom of a sensitive piece of writing about a personal experience This work is terrible There are far too many spelling errors and your writing is illegible It may have been a sharp criticism of the pupil s technical abilities in writing but it was also a sad reflection on the teacher who had omitted to read the essay which contained some beautiful expressions of the child s deep feelings The teacher was not wrong to draw attention to the errors but if his priorities had centered on the child s ideas an expression of his disappointment with the presentation would have given the pupil more motivation to seek improvement Teachers differ in their opinions about A the difficulties in teaching spelling B the necessity of teaching spelling C the complexities of the basic writing skills D the role of spelling in general language development The expression play safe probably means A to write carefully B to avoid using words one is not sure of C to do as teachers say D to use dictionaries frequently Teachers encourage the use of dictionaries so that A teachers will have less trouble in correcting mistakes B students will have more confidence in writing C students will be able to express their ideas more freely D students will learn to be independent of teachers The major point discussed in the passage is A the relationship between spelling and content of a composition B the importance of developing writhing skills C the correct way of marking compositions D the complexities of spelling D Cheaters called pirates often use camcorders and cell phones to make illegal copies of blockbusters in the local theater These pirates then sell those recordings on the street or over the Internet for very low prices Some share them for free It s unfair for people to pirate movies says year old Hadaia Azad Ezzulddin Movie piracy takes money out of the pockets of thousands of people in the movie industry she notes Victims include famous actors and directors as well as local theater owners and their employees Hadaia came up with an idea that could help stop movie piracy Hadaia s idea uses infrared light This range of light is invisible to the human eye It is visible however to many types of cameras Theater owners could place small infrared lights on their movie screens The lights would not disturb people watching the movie It would however distort the recordings made by many types of cameras To test her idea Hadaia built a box with a movie screen inside Then she projected images on that screen through a hole in the box She took recordings of those images using nine different types of cameras These included the types found in cell phones as well as camcorders During some tests she also turned on light emitting diodes or LEDs The LEDs were embedded in a certain place behind the movie screen They gave out infrared light Sure enough she showed a pirated movie included odd stripes or spots if it had been recorded while the LEDs were on It might be possible to use the LEDs to flash the date and time on the movie screen The information would then appear in the illegal recordings Theater owners or police might use the information to track down the pirates Cutting down on piracy might get more people into theaters to watch the real movie instead of an illegal copy Six out of every ten films now produced aren t profitable They don t make enough money to recover how much was spent to make and market them Such a poor payback can discourage filmmakers from producing anything but the types expected to become blockbuster hits It might also keep smaller theaters from showing a wider variety of movie types From what Hadaia says in Paragraph we can infer that A most people spend less money on pirates moves B the pirates don t have to pay for the movie tickets C theater owners will increase the price of movie tickets D she strongly criticizes those who video movies in the theater Infrared lights are put on the movie screens to A adjust the brightness of the movie screens B make sure the images of movies are dark C make illegal copies of movies unpleasant to see D protect the eyesight of viewers in the darkness What is the correct order of the steps in Hadaia s test a She projected pictures on the screen b She used cameras to record the pictures c She turned on the LEDs placed behind the screen d She made a special box with a movie screen inside A d c a b B d b a c C b a c d D b c a d According to the last paragraph we can know that A forty percent of movies now are profitable B small theaters often choose to show low cost movies C more and more people go to theaters to fight movie piracy D filmmakers prefer to produce ordinary movies than blockbusters Taking a math test can be pretty stressful Even if you know the material you can still get the problem wrong Knowing how to go through your math test and check your work can save you from handing in a test full of mistakes that can be avoided Write it out You can also check a math problem by writing everything out on paper Writing out math problems reduces your chances of missing anything to the lowest possible level which is a common cause of incorrect answers Make sure your answers work by doing the opposite procedure of what your problem calls for including the answer you got the first time around In other words you would use the opposite of this addition problem subtraction to determine whether or not your answer is the correct one Plugging in You may find that a variable isn t good enough or have a problem where you have to solve for a variable This is the only real way to assure yourself that the answer you ve found is correct Check for a reasonable answer For example if you get an answer in the millions and you know it should be in the thousands you ve likely misplaced a point Go back through the work on your paper to make sure all of your formulas and calculations are correct If everything looks okay do the problem again and compare the result of the second try to what you ve got on the first try A Do the opposite B Correct the answers C Plug the variable in the equation to check it out D Therefore you ll improve your grades as well as your math skills E It also helps you to figure out everything after you have already finished the test F If the result of a problem seems to make no sense it indicates that the answer is incorrect G This helps you to know what information you have and what information you need to solve A few years ago my mother asked me to go shopping with her because she needed a new dress I don t like to shop with others

never yelled at us for playing in his yard but was always very kind When Doctor Gibbs wasn t saving lives he was planting trees He had some interesting theories about planting trees He believed in the principle No pain no gain He hardly watered his new trees which flew in the face of conventional wisdom Once I asked why and he told me that watering plants spoiled them because it made them grow weaker He said you had to make things tough for the trees so that only the strongest could survive He talked about how watering trees made them develop shallow roots and how if they were not watered trees would grow deep roots in search of water So instead of watering his trees every morning he d beat them with a rolled up newspaper I asked him why he did that and he said it was to get the tree s attention Doctor Gibbs died a couple of years after I left home Every now and then I walked by his house and looked at the trees that I d watched him plant some twenty five years ago They were all tall and strong I planted a couple of trees myself a few years ago Two years of attending these trees meant they grew up weak Whenever a cold wind blew their branches trembled Adversity seemed to benefit Doctor Gibb s trees in ways comfort and ease never could Every night before I go to bed I check on my two sons I often pray that their lives will be easy But lately I ve been thinking that it s time to change my prayer I know my children are going to meet with hardship There s always a cold wind blowing somewhere What we need to do is to pray for deep roots so when the rains fall and the

stand the rain and wind in their lives Which of the following can be the best title of the passage A Prayers for my sons B Doctor Gibbs and his trees C Growing roots D Watering trees B Evergreen Teen

United States Bexar County s so called Biblio Tech is a low cost project with big ambitions Its first branch is in a relatively poor district on the south side of the city of San Antonio It has e readers on loan and dozens of screens where the public are able to browse study and learn digital skills It is a truly bookless library although that is not a phrase much to the liking of BiblioTech s project co ordinator Laura Cole She prefers the description digital library after all there are books there but in digital form Christopher Platt director of collections and circulation at the New York Public Library argued that accessing a digital version of a book was not enough People travel from all over the world to our library not just to access an item but to touch it and feel it in order to get a sense of the overall importance of the work he said But bookless does not mean cheap Publishers charge libraries up to five times the normal hardback price for an e book of a popular title Christopher Platt said And certain types of e books simply do not work as well as printed books especially when some library e readers are still text only This was just one of many reasons he felt that bookless libraries would not be sweeping the board just yet Children s author Alan Gibbons is a firm believer in the role of libraries especially school libraries Working in international schools in China and Thailand Mr Gibbons noted that even in the best schools where every child was given an iPad the school library stocked with real books was seen as an important resource Christopher Platt at the New York Public Library has another view on the bookless future It s still early We ve spent years getting the print stuff right so it could be a while before we get the e stuff right What can we learn about the paperless public library in Texas A It was built in a rich district B People can develop digital skills there C It cost a large sum of money D It s the world s biggest library By saying bookless does not mean cheap Christopher Platt means that A travelling to the library costs foreign readers a lot B e readers are very expensive C readers must pay to read in the digital library D e books are more expensive than printed ones The underlined phrase sweeping the board in Paragraph probably means A fading out B leaving quickly C becoming successful D coming soon Which of the following might Alan Gibbons agree with A School libraries with printed books won t disappear B Asian children like printed books C Asian children like electronic products D Printed books in school libraries need improving D You get anxious if there s no wi fi in the hotel or mobile phone signal up the mountain You feel upset if your phone is getting low on power and you secretly worry things will go wrong at work if you re not there All these can be called always on stress caused by smartphone addiction For some people smartphones have liberated them from the nine to five work Flexible working has given them more autonomy in their working lives and enabled them to spend more time with their friends and families For many others though smartphones have become tyrants in their pockets never allowing them to turn them off relax and recharge their batteries Pittsburgh based developer Kevin Holesh was worried about how much he was ignoring his family and friends in favour of his iPhone So he developed an app Moment to monitor his usage The app enables users to see how much time they re spending on the device and set up warnings if the usage limits are breached Moment s goal is to promote balance in your life his website explains Some time on your phone some time off it enjoying your loving family and friends around you Dr Christine Grant an occupational psychologist at Coventry University said The effects of this always on culture are that your mind is never resting and you re not giving your body time to recover so you re always stressed And the more tired and stressed we get the more mistakes we make Physical and mental health can suffer And as the number of connected smartphones is increasing so is the amount of data This is leading to a sort of decision paralysis and is creating more stress in the workplace because people have to receive a broader range of data and communications which are often difficult to manage It actually makes it more difficult to make decisions and many do less because they re controlled by it all and feel they can never escape the office said Dr Christine Grant What s the first paragraph mainly about A The popularity of smartphones B The progress of modern technology C The signs of always on stress D The cause of smartphone addiction Kevin Holesh developed Moment to A research how people use their mobile phones B help people control their use of mobile phones C make people better use mobile phones D increase the fun of using mobile phones What s Dr Christine Grant s attitude towards always on culture A Confused B Positive C Doubtful D Critical According to the last paragraph a greater amount of data means A we will become less productive B we can make a decision more quickly C we will be equipped with more knowledge D we can work more effectively Travel tips that are no longer true We all love an inside trip but some of the classic tips for travelers no longer hold true Book a plane

hotel to negotiate a good deal on a room Many hotel chains offer rate guarantees and encourage customers to book directly Hotels also frequently have discounts or some offers that third party websites

Yesterday as I approached the front door of our public library a white haired gentleman stepped back to hold the door for me You see I have to go everywhere these days with a walker and folks are constant holding or opening doors for me so this was not unusual However I told the gentleman that the door had automatic opener and he did not need to stay to hold it open He said Here I thought I would have an opportunity to be help At that I backed up let the door close and allowed him to reopen the door not use the automatic control this time His comment then was Well now I feel like that I accomplish something helpful and worthwhile today We never know someone else is feeling We seniors seem to feel we can take care of at all times That random act of kindness brightened not only my day but my joy and delight also the day of that white haired senior citizen I felt a glow for the rest of the day and hopefully so did he So gentle readers never hesitate offer kindness You may find to

fact that the Internet usage was growing at percent per year I d never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast and the idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles was very exciting to me I had just turned years old and I d been married for a year I told my wife MacKenzie that I wanted to quit my job and go to do this crazy thing that probably wouldn t work since most start ups don t and I wasn t sure what to expect MacKenzie told me I should go for it As a young boy I d been a garage inventor I d always wanted to be an inventor and she wanted me to follow my passion I was working at a financial firm in New York City with a bunch of very smart people and I had a brilliant boss that I much admired I went to my boss and told him I wanted to start a company selling books on the Internet He took me on a long walk in Central Park listened carefully to me and finally said That sounds like a really good idea but it would be an even better idea for someone who didn t already have a good job That logic made some sense to me and he convinced me to think about it for hours before making a final decision Seen in that light it really was a difficult choice but finally I decided I had to give it a shot I didn t think I d regret trying and failing And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all After much consideration I took the less safe path to follow my passion and I m proud of that choice For all of us in the end we are our choices What inspired the author with the idea of building an online bookstore A His dream of being an inventor B The support of his wife C The greatly increasing usage of the Internet D Millions of exciting titles Which of the following is closest in meaning to the underlined sentence A The idea of not trying would keep coming to his mind and disturb him B He would be very excited if he tried it out C He would be always having a doubt if he didn t try D The decision to not try the online bookstore would terrify him We can know from the passage that A the boss thought the idea was suitable for the author B the author wanted someone else to try the idea C the author might not regret if he failed the idea D the author might go back to his boss if he failed Which of the following would be the best title for the passage A Cleverness and Kindness B The Starting of Amazon C Following My Passion D We Are What We Choose B In Britain and other countries young people sometimes take a gap year a year off between high school and college This idea never gained a big following in America Recent news reports have suggested that interest may be growing though there are no official numbers Charles Deacon Dean of Admissions at Georgetown University in Washington D C estimates that in the current first year class of students only about decided to take a year off He says this number has not changed much over the years Mr Deacon says the most common reason for taking a gap year is to have a chance to travel but he says international students may take a gap year to meet requirements at home for military duty Some high school graduates see a year off as a chance to recover after twelve years of required education but it can also give students a chance to explore their interests Students hoping to be doctors for example could learn about the profession by volunteering in a hospital Many colleges and universities support gap year projects by permitting students to delay their admission Experts say students can grow emotionally and intellectually as they work at something they enjoy The Harvard admissions office has an essay on its website called Time Out or Burn Out for the Next Generation It praises the idea of taking time off to step back think and enjoy gaining life experiences outside the pressure of studies It also notes that students are sometimes admitted to Harvard or other colleges partly because they did something unusual with that time Of course a gap year is not for everyone Students might miss their friends who go on directly to college And parents might worry that their children will decide not to go to college once they take time off Another concern is money A year off away from home can be costly Holly Bull s job is to specialize in helping students plan their gap year She notes that several books have been written about this subject She says these books along with media attention and the availability of information on the Internet have increased interest in the idea of a year off and she points out that many gap year programs cost far less than a year of college What is the passage mainly about A More and more American students are choosing to take a year off B If you want to go to an American university take a gap year first C It is likely that taking a gap year is becoming popular in America D Americans hold different opinions towards students taking a gap year How many reasons for students taking a gap year are mentioned in the passage A B C D The essay Time Out or Burn Out for the Next Generation suggests that A every student must take a gap year before applying for a famous university B some famous universities encourage students to gain more life experiences C taking a gap year can make students free from life learning D the stress of studies does harm to the students health What can we learn from the passage A Books and media have contributed to the students interest in school learning B Charles Deacon doesn t support the idea of the students taking a gap year C Parents night disagree with the program concerned about their children s future D Experts agree taking a year off will benefit the students emotionally and physically C In our world today the media and entertainment industries are constantly focusing on beauty over brains Movies television shows commercials and magazines all utilize models and actors whose physical attributes will sell their product As our country becomes so obsessed with trying to reduce the obesity numbers eating disorder statistics continue to increase due to the push for thinner people While obesity is a serious medical condition that can lead to many health problems many of us try to lose weight for appearance purposes Children as young as elementary school age have begun to worry about the numbers that appear on the scale In my opinion it seems that fat has become the new ugly Two weeks ago year old Wisconsin television reporter Livingston who is pounds received an email from a man named Krause In the email Krause attacked her writing Your physical condition hasn t improved for many years Surely you don t consider yourself a suitable example for this community s young people girls in particular Today it seems that a vast majority of people care more about how they look and appear to their peers rather than what is inside The truth is that every person is built differently we all come in different shapes and sizes Someone is heavier which doesn t mean they eat large amounts of junk food and lounge around all day Likewise even though a person is thin it doesn t mean they are necessarily healthy and fit If you are reading this and you struggle with your weight or your appearance please recognize that you are beautiful and special in your own way You are worth h so much more than you realize and even if I don t know you understand that I respect and support you Beauty is not defined by size it is defined by how we treat others and respect ourselves In the words of the talented film actress Kirstie Alley There s a lot more to life than how fat or thin you are According to the author why do elementary school children worry about the numbers that appear on the scale A They want to appear in ads to sell their product B They are concerned about their health C They are suffering from eating disorder D They want to look slim The writer used the example of Jennifer Livingston to show A people think fat looks ugly B fat people should lose weight C physical condition needs improving D young girls won t follow fat models What Kirstie Alley said means A people should pay attention to the appearance B there is no need for any people to go on diet C people are beautiful when they concern others D there s always someone who understands and supports you D Rats that eat high levels of a natural sugar known as fructose seem to age faster than other rats and the same could be true for people who eat too much sweet junk food Israeli researchers said Monday Fructose found naturally in honey and fruit is used widely in foods ranging from soft drinks to yogurt But while its sweet taste is popular the sugar could cause wrinkles the researchers said Dr Moshe Werman and Boaz Levi of the Technion Israel Institute of Technology fed large amounts of fructose to laboratory rats Writing in the Journal of Nutrition they said the fructose fed rats showed changes in the collagen of their skin and bones Collagen basically holds the body together The loss of collagen is what causes loose skin and deep wrinkles in older people The process affected Werman s team said is known as cross linking Too much cross linking makes the skin stiff and these are the conditions that encourage wrinkled skin Werman said in a statement He said the same could be true of people although this has not been shown Americans are eating more and more processed foods such as baked goods canned fruits jams and dairy products that contain fructose Werman said Other studies have shown that taking in high fructose may cause diabetes The rats Werman worked with were fed much more than the average adult person might eat in a day which is standard in such experiments The rats were fed grams of fructose per kg of weight every day for a year In the experiments if a rat was kg it ma have been fed about grams of fructose every day for a year A B C D Why do older people have deep wrinkles according to the passage A They don t drink enough water every day B They don t take enough exercise every day C Collagen in their body is lost D Their daily foods do not contain enough fructose What can we learn from the passage A The fructose fed rats only showed changes in the collagen of their sk n B Too much cross linking makes the skin soft C The amount of sugar the rats ate was larger than an ordinary adult might eat in a day D It hasn t been shown that taking in high fructose may cause diabetes The best title for the passage should be A Sugar it could reduce collagen B Collagen it could age you C Collagen it could cause wrinkles D Sugar it could age you As a child grows Lip you may wonder how you can teach him to become a respectful adult A child who learns to respect riot only learns to receive respect from others in kind but also learns to respect himself Show him respect This is the best way to teach your child how to respect others Listen to your child attentively and he will learn to listen to you understanding how important this is in communication The more you say please and thank you to your child the more likely he will learn to use them Politeness then becomes a normal part of any conversation Agree to disagree Explain your decision so that he will understand you and expect respectful responses Disagreeing with you doesn t necessarily mean disobedience Control your impulse to overreact When a situation arises stay calm and keep in mind that you are supposed to be modeling correct behavior Praise praise praise So much is focused on what a child does wrong and how to correct it that his accomplishments are not celebrated enough A Teach manners by using polite requests and responses B Respectful behavior is always accompanied by bad behavior as a child C Respect is necessary for a meaningful and successful life D If he sees you lose your temper he is more likely to respond that way in future E A child may act as he pleases and he will live a happy life F Seeing a child exhibit respectful behavior make sure he knows how proud you are of him G Try to remember that a child won t always agree with you A B C D One day all the employees of a very famous company reached their office and all saw a big sign on the main door which said this Yesterday the who has been hindering your progress in this company We

did not go to learn they went to teach the American Bankers Association has sponsored Teach Children to Save Day Every April bankers across the USA teach over l million primary and secondary school

little different in different countries but it usually means one who offers his or her services There are many different ways in which people can volunteer such as taking care of sick people working in homes for homeless children and picking up garbage from beaches and parks Volunteers may work within their own countries or in other countries They are often people with a strong wish to help those who are less fortunate than themselves Volunteers don t expect any kind of pay At the root of volunteering is the idea that one person may have the ability to offer services that can help other people Tracy a good friend of mine however recently came back from India with a new idea of what being a volunteer means She worked for two and a half weeks in one of Mother Teresa s homes in Calcutta The following is her story I first heard about Mother Teresa in my high school We watched a video about her work in India and all over the world I was so moved by her spirit to help others and her endless love for every human being that after I graduated from high school I too wanted to try her kind of work So with two friends I flew to Calcutta for a few weeks I was asked to work in a home for sick people I helped wash clothes and sheets and pass out lunch I also fed the people who were too weak to feed themselves and tried to cheer them up I felt it was better to share with them than to think that I had helped them To be honest I don t think I was helping very much It was then that I realized that I had not really come to help but to learn about and experience another culture that helped improve my own understanding of life and the world According to the text a volunteer refers to a person who A is willing to help those in need without pay B can afford to travel to different places C has a strong wish to be successful D has made a big fortune in life Tracy started her work as a volunteer A after she met Mother Teresa B after she finished high school C when she was touring Calcutta D when she was working in a hospital Why did Tracy choose to be a volunteer A She liked to work with Mother Teresa B She had already had some experience C She was asked by Mother Teresa s example D She wanted to follow Mother Teresa s example What is Tracy s new idea Paragraph of being a volunteer A Going abroad to help the sick B Working in Mother Teresa s home C Doing simple things to help the poor D Improving oneself through helping others B Two years ago we were at a turning point in our lives in New Zealand so we decided to start an adventure We gave up our jobs said goodbye to friends and family and went to live in Switzerland Settling in the small town of Aadorf we sent our daughters who were and at the time to the local school They were the only English speakers in the school and as they had no German or local Swiss dialect we knew their path would be hard But after only a few months the girls were doing really well and making every effort to integrate into the Swiss way of life As a result the local newspaper ran a story about them When the half page article complete with a photo appeared in the newspaper the girls were delighted But what followed next still had us shaking our heads in astonishment A teacher from the school showed the article to a friend who sent the article to friends of his a Swiss family who happened to be nearing the end of their month stay in New Zealand When they read how we missed feijoas a fruit unknown in Switzerland they looked out of the window at the huge feijoa tree weighed down with fruit So they picked two kilograms of feijoas and brought them back with them to Switzerland especially for us They gave the fruit to their friend who then drove two hours to secretly deliver the precious load to us When we opened the front door

Strangely it is in a town that calls itself Butterfly USA Pacific Grove California The town of Pacific Grove loves the butterflies Every year they have a parade and hundreds of children dress up as butterflies Monarch butterflies are the town mascot Tourism is very important and many people come to see the butterflies The butterflies are good for the development of the town In there were so many butterflies it looked like it was raining butterflies Tens of thousands of Monarchs stayed on tree branches near Pacific Grove Now there are not so many The building goes on a little bit at a time and you don t notice it day by day Over time you can see that there has been a lot of development As new buildings go up many trees are cut down This reduces the natural homes for the butterflies Monarchs travel hundreds of miles each year returning to the same woods often to the same trees The female Monarchs need milkweed to lay their eggs the males will follow the females Millions of Monarchs have traveled regularly along the same path for thousands of years They start their trip in the mountains of Mexico and travel to the middle part of America If the woods where the butterflies live are

start slowing down at the cruelly young age of It used to be thought that this couldn t be helped but new studies show that people of any age can train their brains to work faster Your brain is a learning machine says University of California scientist Dr Michael Merzenich Given the right tools we can train our brains to act like they did when we were younger All that s required is the practice designed just for the purpose a few exercises for the mind Merzenich has developed a computer based training method to speed up the process in which the brain deals with information positscience com Since much of the data we receive comes through speech the Brain Fitness Program works with language and hearing to better speed and accuracy Over the course of training the program starts asking you to distinguish sounds between dog and bog for example at an increasingly faster speed It s a bit like tennis instructor says Merzenich hitting balls at you faster and faster to keep you challenged You may start out slow but before long you re pretty quick The biggest finding in brain research in the last ten years is that the brain at any age is highly plastic If you ask your brain to learn it will learn And it may even speed up while in the process To keep your brain young and plastic you can do one of a million new activities that challenge and excite you playing table tennis or bridge doing crossword puzzles learning a language When it comes to preventing ageing you really do use it or lose it says Barbara Sahakian professor at Cambridge University Dr Merzenich s training method mainly depends on A speech training B computer languages C the activities one joins in D the information being dealt with By saying the brain at any age is highly plastic the writer probably means the brain can be A used B mastered C developed D researched What can we learn from the text A Practice makes a quick mind B Brain research started ten yeas ago C Dr Merzenich is a scientist in computer D People believed nothing could stop the brain slowing down Which of the following agrees with the writer s idea A The training methods work better for the old B People should use the brain to stop it from ageing C The training of the brain should start at an early age D It s necessary to take part in as many activities as possible Hi Andy Nice to see you back Terrible I don t want to talk about it Why Something unpleasant happened You got robbed attacked or No nothing like that It just wasn t any fun That s all I don t get it No the books were quite helpful but the trip was bad Er No You know how careful I am about things like that No everywhere we went was clean Then was it the weather No It s just that I forget to mention the self in the self planned travel The problem was Alice She was always complaining So the next time I m travelling I m travelling alone II II When I was a boy growing up in New Jersey in the s we had a milkman delivering milk to our doorstep His name was Mr Basille He wore a white cap and drove a white truck As a year old boy I couldn t take my eyes off the coin changer fixed to his belt He noticed this one day during a delivery and gave me a quarter out of his coin changer Of course he delivered more than milk There was cheese eggs and so on If we needed to change our order my mother would pen a note Please add a bottle of buttermilk next delivery and place it in the box along with the empty bottles And then the buttermilk would magically appear All of this was about more than convenience There existed a close relationship between families and their milkmen Mr Basille even had a key to our house for those times when it was so cold outside that we put the box indoors so that the milk wouldn t freeze And I remember Mr Basille from time to time taking a break at our kitchen table having a cup of tea and telling stories about his delivery Mr Basille always said delivering milk is hard if you want to do it well but I love my job There is sadly no home milk delivery today Big companies allowed the production of cheaper milk thus making it difficult for milkmen to compete Besides milk is for sale everywhere and it may just not have been practical to have a delivery service Recently an old milk box in the countryside I saw brought back my childhood memories I took it home and planted it on the back porch Often my son s friends will ask what it is So I start telling stories of my boyhood and of the milkman who brought us friendship along with his milk Why did Mr Basille give the boy a quarter out of his coin changer within words How could the author s mother change their order within words Why did the author s family put the box indoors within words What made it difficult for milkmen to compete with big companies within words What did Mr Basille think of his job within words When our six children were young suppertime is always being interrupted by neighborhood children ring the bell They wanted one child or another to go out and played Finally we had good idea We hung a sign on the front door that was read We re having dinner Come back later That night we sat down to what they thought would be a pleasant uninterrupted meals And as soon as we began dinner the doorbell rang At the front door stood a five year old boy from across the street He looked to us and said I just want to know what the sign say As we grow up we are bound to meet with difficulties in our study To satisfy the boy s curiosity Because the boy was interested in the coin changer Because he noticed the boy s eyes fixed on it Because the boy showed interest in the coin changer By placing a note in the box By penning a note and putting it in the box To prevent the milk from freezing Because the milk wouldn t freeze indoors The production of cheaper milk Cheaper milk by big companies It was hard but he loved it Hard but enjoyable is was ring ringing played play good a was they we meals meal And But to at say says As we grow up we are bound to meet with difficulties in our study A difficulty I encountered was that I had strong Chinese accent while communicating with others in English making everyone laugh at me Confronted with the difficulty I bought lots of CDs of native speakers public speaking and tried to imitate their intonation every day Besides I often turned to the teacher for help who always helped correct my pronunciation As a result I made great progress I I II A B C What s the woman s telephone number A B C Why does the woman want to go to Qingdao A It s

A B C D A There was once a king who had a wise advisor The advisor followed the king everywhere and his favorite piece of advice to the king was Everything happens for the good One day the king went hunting and had a small accident His foot was injured Fortunately he was not badly injured but as always he was forced to ask his advisor what he thought about the accident to which the advisor replied Everything happens for the good This time the king was really angry and put his advisor in prison The king then asked his advisor Now what do you think The advisor again answered Everything happens for the good About a week later the king went on another hunting trip As it turned out the king was caught by some cannibals and taken to their camp where he would be prepared to be their evening meal Before putting him into the cooking pot he was examined and the cannibals realized that the king s foot was injured They decided to throw him back into the forests It is the tradition for the cannibals not to eat anything that was in any way injured It is true that everything in our lives happens for a purpose and most often for our own good If you think about it all our past

any more C wishes us to follow others advice D wants us to think positively B Last week I visited my grandparents My aunt was also staying there for a few nights for a family visit My grandma had told

economy has undergone many reforms in an effort to compete more effectively on the international market These reforms included allowing foreign banks to offer credit cards to Chinese citizens Now researchers at the University of Missouri MU have found about of Chinese urban households now own at least one credit card and the growth rate of credit adoption has been an average of per year between and Rui Yao an assistant professor of personal financial planning at MU says that this large growth in such a small amount of time has positive and negative implications for the Chinese economy With more and more people taking advantage of credit cards in China it certainly increases potential consumer buying power Yao said However we found that more than of credit card users were unaware of safety issues existing in credit card use and more than had little knowledge of the consequences of credit card debt This lack of knowledge could create problems as credit card ownership is expected to grow at a rate of a year Yao found that while of Chinese credit card holders were never late on their payment only were able to pay the full balance She also found that of Chinese credit card holders said that credit cards contributed to overspending Yao believe that Chinese could benefit from financial education designed to help them plan for their financial future and encouraging the Chinese to take advantage of debt in a responsible fashion is important for the Chinese economy Appropriate use of debt can help households improve their quality of life as well as spur economic growth through an increase in market purchases Yao said Why did China allow foreign banks to offer credit cards to Chinese citizens A To increase Chinese citizen s confidence in economy B To respond to the urgent demand for financial reforms C To persuade more Chinese citizens to accept credit cards D To improve competitiveness in the international market A lot of figures are used in the text in order to A provide concrete evidence B record the valuable date C give a detailed description D introduce a research method It can be inferred from the text that A education is the only solutions to future financial issues B overspending is mainly brought about by credit cards C some Chinese citizens lack knowledge of credit risks D most Chinese credit card holders can t pay the balance The underlined word spur in the last paragraph is closest in the meaning to A promote B delay C control D discourage Mosquitoes have an extraordinary ability to target humans far away and fly straight to their unprotected skin Some mosquitoes spread several serious diseases including Dengue yellow fever and malaria Over one million people worldwide die from these mosquito borne diseases each year New research now shows how mosquitoes choose who to bite They are attracted to human skin and breath They smell the carbon dioxide gas which all mammals breathe out This gas is how mosquitoes know that a warm blooded creature is nearby Michael Dickinson is a professor at the California Institute of Technology His research shows how these small insects with even smaller brains use three senses to find a blood meal We suspected from research that we had been doing on fruit flies that vision might play a very large and underappreciated role in allowing the mosquito to really home in on the potential host target Michael Dickinson s team used plumes material that rises into the air of carbon dioxide gas into a wind tunnel The insects followed the plume Then the scientists placed dark objects on the lighter colored floor and walls of the tunnel Mr Dickinson said at first the mosquitoes showed no interest in the objects at all What was quite striking and quite surprising is that the mosquitoes fly back and forth for hours these are hungry females and they completely ignore the objects on the floor and wall of the tunnel But the moment that they get a hit of CO they change their behavior quite dramatically and now would become attracted to these little visual blobs A But mosquitoes also use their eyes and sense of touch B Once mosquitoes catch a smell of a human or animal they also follow visual cues C Regrettably mosquitoes can do more than cause an itchy wound D They then used cameras to record the mosquitoes E Mosquitoes need blood to survive F The study published in Current Biology details the steps of the mosquito s flight so that we may one day have a fighting chance against the biting insect G This suggested to the researchers that a mosquito s sense of smell is more important in the search for food A B C D It is universally acknowledged that fresh food is beneficial to our health As a small child I didn t know about the benefits of fresh food I considered canned fish and fruit bottled soft drinks and snacks to be the most appetizing As I learned to prefer fresh and foods to the artificial taste of chemically enhanced snacks I began to starting a vegetable

finishtough tasks usually carried out by men For example she carries litre waterto her dormitory on the th floor I depend on no one but myself she says According to a recent survey by China Youth Daily tough women havebecome rather common in society Of the respondents percent saidthey are familiar with a tough woman About percent said they like womenwith tough characteristics while less than percent expressed the oppositeview Why are tough women gaining popularity Shen Meng a psychologicalconsultant believes the fierce competition in society is contributing to thistrend Women are often in a disadvantaged position compared to men Shensays In order to survive they have to be independent strong and tough Liu Xiaolin professor of psychology at Wuhan Mental Health Center believestough women are brought up this way They are often on close relationship withtheir fathers who teach their daughters to be brave and decisive he says As aresult these women are more likely to be psychologically healthy and moretolerant to stress according to Liu Though Liu believes that this is a good trend Hu Shenzhi a psychologistat the Guangdong Sunflower Counseling Center says the popularity of

different characteristics form traditional female images C We are all interested in equality but while some people try to protect theschool and examination system in the name of equality others still in the nameof equality want only to destroy it Any society which is interested in equality of opportunity and standards ofachievement must regularly test its pupils The standards may be changed noexamination is perfect but to have tests or examinations would mean the endof equality and of standards There are groups of people who oppose this viewand who do not believe either in examinations or in any controls in school or onteachers This would mean that everything would depend on luck since everypupil would depend on the efficiency the values and the purpose of eachteacher Without examinations employers will look for employees from the highlyrespected schools and from families known to them a form of favoritismwill replace equality At the moment the bright child from an ill respectedschool can show certificates to prove he or she is suitable for a job while thelack of certificate indicates the unsuitability of a dull child attending awell respected school This defending of excellence and opportunity woulddisappear if examinations were taken away and the bright child from a poorfamily would be a prisoner of his or her school s reputation unable tocompete for employment with the child from the favored school The opponents of the examination system suggest that examinations are anevil force because they show differences between pupils According to thesepeople there must be no special different academic class They have evensuggested that there should be no form of difference in sport or any other area all jobs or posts should be filled by unsystematic selection The selection wouldbe made by people who themselves are probably selected by some computers The word favoritism is used to describe the phenomenon that A children from well respected schools tend to have good jobs B bright children also need certificates go get satisfying jobs C poor children with certificates are favored in job markets D children attending ordinary schools achieve great success What would happen if exams were taken away according to the author A Schools for bright children would lose their reputation B There would be more opportunities and excellence C Children s job opportunity would be affected by their school reputation D Children from poor families would be able to change their schools The opponents of the examination system will agree that A computers should be selected to take over many jobs B jobs should not be assigned by systematic selection C special classes are necessary to keep the school standards D schools with academic subjects should be done away with The passage mainly focuses on A examination and equality B schools and certificates C opportunity and employment D standards and reputation D As you are probably aware the latest job markets news isn t good Unemployment is still more than percent and new job growth has fallen closeto zero That s bad for the economy of course And it may be especiallydiscouraging if you happen to be looking for a job or hoping to change careersright now But it actually shouldn t matter to you nearly as much as you think That s because job growth numbers don t matter to job hunters as much as jobstaff turnover data After all existing jobs open up every day due topromotions resignations and retirements Yes people are retiring evenin this economy In both good times and bad staff turnover creates moreopenings than economic growth does Even in June of when the economywas still booming along job growth was only while staff turnoverwas million And as it turns out even today with job growth near zero over millionjob hunters are being hired every month I don t mean to imply that overall job growth doesn t have an impact onone s ability to land a job

immediately Neither the nor Opus knew that a safety net had been put up at the eighth floor level to some window washers and that Opus would not have been able to complete his suicide anyway because of this In the room on the ninth floor where the shotgun blast went through an elderly man and his wife were arguing and he was her with the shotgun He was so upset that when he pulled the trigger he missed his wife and the pellets went through the window striking the falling Opus The old man said it was his long term habit to threaten his wife with the shotgun He had no to murder her the killing of Opus seemed to be an accident That is the gun had been loaded The continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple s son loading the shotgun six weeks before the fatal incident It turned out that the old lady had his son s financial support and the son knowing the habit of his father to use the shotgun threateningly against his mother loaded the gun with the that his father would shoot his mother Further investigation showed that the son had become increasingly over the failure of his attempt to engineer his mother s murder This led him to jump off the ten storey

for most students Schools and society as a whole often value a student just by his or her performance in the subjects on examination Students with higher grades are considered as winners On the other hand those with lower grades are unfortunately looked upon losers Forced by this expectation students try hard as may to get higher grades Some students do not study hard in their daily lives they try to recite some important facts or rules just the examinations Some students do not even do this they just cheat on the examinations in order to get high grades I believe that a grading system is good and necessary for a school but it should not be the measure of a person s ability Schools set up more elective courses for instance to train the students to solve practical problems Or they can give more consideration to some changes in the examinations can arouse the leaning interest instead of just giving grades PART THREE READING COMPREHENSION Directions Read the following passages Each passage is followed by several questions or unfinished statements For each of them there are choices marked A B C and D choose the one that fits best according to the information given in the passage A On the night of December when he was standing in a parking lot talking to friends Tracy March jumped to the top of a car as he had done a hundred times before This time though Tracy lost his balance His head struck the ground hard All night Cory Tracy s mother stood next to her son who was lying in a hospital bed his brown eyes fixed in a lifeless stare She remembered that Tracy has once mentioned organ donation Maybe I can spare another family this pain she thought When the time came she and her husband Bill signed the forms permitting his organs to be donated Tracy was declared dead the next day Twenty four hours later in a Boston hospital Tracy s liver was made part of my husband David who was suffering from a hopeless liver disease Months later we learned from the local organ bank that the donor s parents wished desperately to meet someone who had gained life through the gift from their son A meeting was arranged by the organ bank to bring together two families linked by the most bittersweet ties imaginable The meeting was risky but worth it We talked for hours They showed us a picture of Tracy We learned for the first how he had lived and died We learned something about Bill and Cory too For the Marches seeing David and knowing he was well seemed to ease their suffering I ll never forget seeing David s tall figure stopped over Corry her arms around his waist as a mother would hug a son For a long time they held each other tight It was hard to know if she was saying hello or good bye Maybe she was saying both We learn from the passage that Tracy died A on December B of brain damage C hours after he fell off the roof of a car D in a car crash Tracy s parents decided to donate Tracy s organs because A Tracy told them to do so just before he died B They wanted to save others the pain of seeing dear one die C David s life could continue in a meaningful way D They knew David was suffering from a hopeless liver disease The meeting between the writer s family and Tracy s parents was arranged because A the writer and her husband wished to express their thanks to Tracy s parents B the local organ bank wanted to see how both families felt about the donation C Tracy s parents wanted to see someone whose life had been saved by the donation D the two families were linked by the most bittersweet ties imaginable The writer and her husband learned how Tracy died A from his parents B from the organ bank C from the hospital D from the doctor who performed the operation The meeting between the two families helped to relieve the Marshes suffering because A they saw that David looked very much like their son B they saw that David had regained health with Tracy s liver C they now had someone to share their memories of Tracy D they now knew for sure they had done the right thing B million road deaths worldwide occur each year plus a further million injuries To reduce car crash rate much research now is focused on safety and new fuels though some electric vehicle and biofuel research aims at going faster Travelling at speed has always been risky One advanced area of research in motoring safety is the use of digital in car assistants They can ensure you don t miss important road signs or fall asleep The use of artificial intelligence software allows these assistants to monitor your driving and make sure your phone or radio doesn t distract you at a vital moment Most crashes result from human and not mechanical faults Some safety developments aim to improve your vision Radar can find obstacles in fog while other technology sees through big vehicles blocking your view And improvements to seat belts pedal controls and tyres are making driving smoother and safer The color of a car has been found to be linked with safety as have less surprisingly size and shape But whatever is in the fuel tank you don t want a thief in the driving seat and there have been many innovations Satellite tracking and remote communications can also come into play if you crash automatically calling for help Accidents cause many traffic jams but there are more subtle interplays between vehicles that can cause jams even on a clear but busy road Such jams can be analyzed using statistical tools Robotic drivers could be programmed to make traffic flow smoothly and will perhaps one day be everyone s personal drivers but their latest efforts suggest that won t be soon What are researchers interested in doing as the road accidents worldwide increase to a shocking rate A They are developing faster electric vehicles B They are analyzing road deaths occurring worldwide every year C They concentrate their research on safety and new fuels D They are designing fully automatic cars According to the second paragraph most road accidents happen A because drivers fall asleep B because drives make mistakes C because of engine failure D because of speeding Which of the safety development is NOT mentioned in the in the passage A Radars that can help drivers to see obstacles in fog B Devices that can help drivers to see through big vehicles C Improvements in seat belts pedal controls and tyres D Windscreens that can help drivers to improve their vision What is NOT the purpose of innovations that use satellite tracking and remote communications A To prevent car thieves from getting into your car B To call for help when one s car crashes C To call for help when the car gets jammed in the traffic D To track the car down when it is being stolen What is true of robotic drivers A It will take some time before robotic drivers can put to practical use B Robotic drivers are not allowed to drive on busy roads C Robotic drivers can never replace human drivers D Robotic drivers are too expensive to use C Fran s husband Tom had a habit of throwing his dirty socks into the laundry basket but frequently missing by a few inches It really frustrated Fran when she had to pick up his socks and place them in the basket After learning the techniques of behavior modification Fran decided to stop nagging her husband and try positive reinforcement When he missed the basket she said nothing and quietly picked up his socks However one day when his socks actually landed in the target she quickly reinforced the appropriate behavior by saying I really like it when you put your socks right inside the basket She followed this statement with a hug Within a week Tom was hitting the target every time or picking up the socks by hand and placing them inside the basket whenever he missed Consequently an argument was avoided There is an old saying that you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar which is the principal behind behavior modification Complaining to someone of doing something whether it s a partner or a child often gets just the opposite response resistance But almost everyone respond to positive reinforcement and this approach to changing someone s behavior takes a little patience and emotional control Experts of behavior modification believe habits are learned because of reinforcement from the environment This theory states that people will always do the behavior that results in the most favorable outcome Even if in the doing there are some negative effects For instance Fran may have learned from her mother that it really didn t matter whether her husband s socks landed in the basket or not It is because she d come along and pick them up for him That was the favorable outcome but if he only got negative messages from Fran for the same behavior he didn t have much motivation to abandon it Of course for some people nothing will work but it s sure worth a try for treating them with a hostile attitude probably won t get you what you want but it will get you a bad relationship with them Positive reinforcement can be used with anyone for any behavior because all of us resist criticism and respond to praise So the next time you want someone to meet your wishes try a little applause for the desired behavior Why does the author present Tom and Fran s story at the beginning of the passage A To introduce the techniques of behavior modification B To show Tom is one of those needing behavior modification C To let the readers know this family D To list ways to get rid of bad habits Which of the following best fits the principle behind behavior modification A Taking no notice of one s occasional good behavior B Praising one for his or her good deeds C Telling a child not to make the same mistakes again D Leaving a child alone when he or she does something wrong Which statement about a habit may the author agree with A Criticism contributes a lot to the formation of a bad habit B Most of our habits are formed in childhood C We can always get along with a person of good habits D A habit is usually reinforced by favorable outcome What can we learn from Paragraph A Positive reinforcement works on anyone B Positive reinforcement should be applied to anyone C By using positive reinforcement we don t fail to get what we want D By using positive reinforcement we can improving our relationship with anyone else The purpose of the passage is to tell us A how to bring out the best in others B the way to get along with others C what behavior modification is D the training of behavior modification PART FOUR WRITING marks SECTION A marks Directions Read the following passage Complete the diagram by using the information from the passage Write NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS for each answer There are certain benefits of eating raw eggs as there are dangers Let me put both the things before you which may help you decide whether eating raw eggs is good or not One good reason for eating or rather drinking raw eggs is that it supplies most of the essential amino acids required for proper functioning of the human body Another good reason to eat eggs is that they provide a bunch of vitamins and minerals like riboflavin folic acid vitamineB vitamin B iron choline calcium potassium and phosphorus Egg is one of the few natural products that contain vitamin D One more nutrient called choline is contained in the egg which is recommended for intake by pregnant and nursing women as it aids brain development The egg white is the richest source of protein on earth This makes it an ideal protein supplement Eating raw eggs for protein is a common practice among body builders One danger from eating raw eggs is getting a salmonella infection The danger is highly overstated however There is a probability of in eggs being infected with salmonella according to a study To stay safe you should purchase eggs from villagers who feed their chickens with organic foods Cold storage of chicken eggs also helps to reduce the risk of infection Another problem is that eating a lot of egg white can lead to lack of biotin However this problem can be dealt with if you eat the whole egg instead of just the egg white as the egg yolk is rich in biotin The high level of cholesterol in egg yolk is another risk however there is no convincing research on how much egg yolk cholesterol can be stored by the body If you have heart problems eating less is recommended Title Good or Bad I giving of most of essential amino acids for the human body to providing a bunch of vitamins and minerals especially for to develop the richest source of protein an

normal emotion that we all feel from time to time Some people express anger openly in a calm reasonable way Others burst with anger and scream and yell But other people keep their anger inside They can not or will not express it This is called repressing anger For years many doctors thought that repressing anger was more dangerous to a person s health than expressing it They said that when a person is angry the brain releases the same hormones They speed the heart rate raise blood pressure or sugar into the blood etc In general the person feels excited and ready to act Some doctors say that both repressing and expressing anger can be dangerous They believe that those who express anger violently may be more likely to develop heart disease and they believe that those who keep their anger inside may face a greater danger of high blood pressure Doctors say the solution is learning how to deal with anger They say the first step is to admit that you are angry and to recognize the real cause of the anger then decide if the cause is serious enough to get angry about If it is they say Do not express your anger while angry Wait until your anger has cooled down and you are able to express yourself calmly and reasonably Doctors say that a good way to deal with anger is to find humor in the situation that has made you angry They said that laughter is much healthier than anger Why

step Any old papers lady asked one of them I was busy I wanted to say no until I looked down at their feet They were wearing thin little sandals wet with heavy snow Come in and I ll make you a cup of hot cocoa They walked over and sat down at the table Their wet sandals left marks upon the floor I served them cocoa and bread to fight against the cold outside Then I went back to the kitchen and started cooking The silence in the front room struck me I looked in The girl held the empty cup in her hands looking at it The boy asked in a flat voice Lady are you rich Am I rich Pity no I looked at my worn out slipcovers The girl put her cup back in its saucer carefully and said Your cups match your saucers They left after that holding their papers against the wind They had reminded me that I had so much for which to be grateful Plain blue china cups and saucers were only worth five pence But they matched I tasted the potatoes and stirred the meat soup Potatoes and brown meat soup a roof

world boys and girls attend a mixed school where they study together But boys schools are the perfect place to teach young men to express their emotions and involve them in activities such as art dance and music Boys at single sex schools were said to be more likely to get involved in cultural and artistic activities that helped develop their emotional expressiveness rather than feeling they had to correspond to the boy code of hiding their emotions to be a real man The findings of the study go against received wisdom that boys do better when taught alongside girls Tony Little head master of Eton warned that boys were being failed by the British education system because it had become too focused on girls He criticized teachers for failing to recognize that boys are actually more emotional than girls The research argued that boys often perform badly in mixed schools because they become discouraged when girls do better earlier in speaking and reading skills But in single sex schools teachers can tailor lessons to boys learning style letting them move around the classroom and getting them to compete in teams to prevent boredom wrote the study s author Abigail James of the University of Virginia Teachers could encourage boys to enjoy reading and writing with boy focused approaches such as themes and characters that appeal to them Because boys generally have more acute vision learn best through touch and are physically more active they need to be given hands on lessons where they are allowed to walk around Boys in mixed schools view classical music as feminine and prefer the modern genre in which violence and sexism are major themes James wrote Single sex education also made it less likely that boys would feel that they had to be masterful and in charge in relationships In mixed schools boys feel forced to act like men before they understand themselves well enough to know what that means the study reported The author believes that a single sex school would A force boys to hide their emotions to be real men B help boys to be more competitive in schools C encourage boys to express their emotions more freely D naturally strengthen boys traditional image of a man It is commonly believed that in a mixed school boys A behave more responsibly B grow up more healthily C perform relatively better D receive a better education According to Abigail James one of the advantages of single sex schools is A teaching can be tailored to suit the characteristics of boys B boys can focus on their lessons without being distracted C boys can choose to learn whatever they are interested in D teaching can be designed to promote boys team spirit What does the underlined word acute in paragraph mean A lovely B sharp C serious D dull D People are being tricked into Facebook with the promise of a fun free service without realizing they re paying for it by giving up loads of personal information Most Facebook users don t realize this is happening Even if they know what the company is up to they still have no idea what they re paying for Facebook because people don t really know what their personal data is worth The biggest problem however is that the company keeps changing the rules early on you keep everything private That was the great thing about Facebook You could create your own little private network Last year The company changed its privacy rules so that many things your city your photo your friends names were set by default to be shared with everyone on the Internet According to Facebook s vice president Elliot Schrage the company is simply making changes to improve its service and if people don t share information They have a less satisfying experience Some critics think this is more about Facebook looking to make more money In original business model which involved selling ads and putting them At the side of the pages totally who wants to look at ads when they re online connecting with their friends The privacy issue has already landed Facebook in hot water in Washington In April Senator Charles Schumer called on Facebook to change its privacy policy He also urged the Federal Trade Commission to set guidelines for social networking sites I think the senator rightly communicated that we had not been clear about what the new products were and how people could choose to use them or not to use them Schrage admits I suspect that whatever Facebook has done so far to invade our privacy it s only the beginning which is why I m considering cancelling my account Facebook is a handy site but I m upset by the idea that my information is in the hands of people I don t know That s too high a price to pay What do we learn about Facebook from the first paragraph A It is a website that sends messages to users who want to get married B It earns money by putting on advertisements C It makes money by selling its users personal data D It provides loads of information to its users What does the author say about most Facebook users A They are unwilling to give up their personal information B They don t know their personal data enriches Facebook C They don t identify themselves when using the website D They care very little about their personal information Why does Facebook make changes to its rules according to Elliot Schrage A To provide better service to its users B To obey the Federal guidelines C To improve its users connection D To expand its business Why does the author plan to cancel his Facebook account A He is dissatisfied with its present service B He finds many of its users untrustworthy C He doesn t want his personal data badly used D He is upset by its frequent rule changes Home on the Way People need homes children assume their parents place as home boarders call school home on weekdays married couples work together to build new homes and travelers have no place to call home at least for a few nights Don t they have the right to a home Of course they do Some regular travelers take their own belongings like bed sheets pillowcases and family photos to make them feel like home no matter where they are some stay for long periods in the same hotel and as a result become very familiar with service and attendants Furthermore driving a camping car during one s travels and sleeping in the vehicle at night is just like home only mobile And how about keeping relationships while in transit some send letters and postcards or even photos others may just call and say hi just to let their friends know that they re still alive and well People find ways to keep in touch Making friends on the way helps travelers feel more or less at home Nowadays fewer people are working in their local towns so how do they develop a sense of belonging Whenever we step out of our local boundaries there is always another home waiting to be found we can make the place we stay home A Hostels provide a clean safe place to stay while you are travelling the world B others may simply put some flowers by the hotel window to make things more homely C Backpackers in youth hostels may become very good friends even closer than siblings D So how about people who have to travel

subject of the English Writing Prize was kept a until the start of the exam so I could not reading it When the headmaster I was looking out of the window I should have told him what had then It would

but it was still cheating anyhow That was thirty eight years when I was fifteen I have never told anyone about it before have I tried to explain to myself why not The obvious explanation is that I

all of us need to know how to learn well Yet evidence suggests that most of us don t use the learning techniques that science has proved the most effective The scientific literature evaluating these techniques goes back to decades and across thousands of articles It s far too extensive and complex for the average parent teacher or employer to look through Fortunately a team of five leading psychologists have done the job for us Professor John Dunlosky and other psychologists closely examined learning strategies and rated each from high to low utility on the basis of the evidence they ve gathered Here s part of their conclusions In contrast to familiar practices the effective learning strategies with the most evidence to support them aren t well known outside the lab Take distributed practice for example This strategy involves spreading out your study time rather than engaging in one marathon Cramming information at the last minute may allow you to get through that test or meeting but the material will quickly disappear from your memory It s much more effective to look through the material at intervals over time And the longer you want to remember the information whether it s two weeks or two years the longer the intervals should be The second learning strategy that is highly recommended by Dunlosky is practice testing Yes more tests but there not for a grade Research shows that the mere act of calling information to mind strengthens that knowledge and aids in future retrieval While practice testing is not a common strategy despite the strong evidence supporting it there is one familiar approach that captures its benefits using flash cards And now flash cards can be presented in digital form Both distributed practice and practice testing were rated as having high utility by Dunlosky How did the psychologists study and rate the learning strategies A By analyzing the materials gathered in the past years B By asking some students questions about their study C By doing some experiments on the objects in the lab D By asking parents and teachers to look through the articles About distributed practice and practice testing it s true that A many students have benefited a lot from them B they were first put forward by John Dunlosky C only a small number of experts know about them D psychologists are studying whether they are effective The strategy of distributed practice shows that A we should not study for long hours every day B reviewing what we have studied is of little help C the shorter the interval is the better we ll study D doing repetition at intervals is the best way The evidence shows that the strategy of practice testing A is a way to use flash cards to help study B is mainly used to help us remember well C helps know about students grades in time D is a way widely used to strengthen memory C We often associate off season travel with cost cutting You know it s something to be done as a last resort not something that you actively look forward to And it surely is reasonable isn t it Off season just seems like a polite term for depressing weather and a lack of good conditions for traveling Recently however this term has begun to gain a steady stream of followers The so called peak season on the other hand is constantly losing ground owing to the large crowds and high costs that tend to be associated with it Off season travel isn t to everyone s taste So this is the time when airline companies come down to earth and offer a bunch of gifts to keep their business going on You can mainly expect lowered fares and automatic upgrades if you re a frequent traveler Off season means an encouragement for the hotel businesses as well Ordinarily star luxury is only something that we tend to dream of but this is the perfect time to transform this into reality Grand chain hotels cut their rates like crazy in order to fill up their rooms during this time and worry not the availability is fairly acceptable too So make the most of it and book a fashionable room in a star Of course you re free to spend the amount you ve thus saved in shopping Every season has its own charm doesn t it For instance people usually prefer to visit Europe in the summer which is regarded as the best time to be there But really doesn t it get rather sweltering if you re in Naples or Madrid in July Ever spent a Christmas in either places It s highly recommended if I may add It s the perfect quiet period vacation you ll have Hell it can be the most perfect vacation you ll ever have Who has ever liked to be pushed and shouldered while taking a photo during an amazing Copacabana sunset Or have their wallet stolen in a crowded street Off season travel translates to privacy peace of mind and relaxation The author wrote the passage mainly to A change readers traditional life style B state the advantages of off season traveling C encourage readers to travel in peak seasons D compare the difference of traveling in different seasons In Paragraph the author wants to stress A the luxury of star hotels B the comfort of air traveling C the better service than that in other seasons D the low cost of off season journey The author suggests traveling to Europe in winter because A people usually feel bored in summer B people regard winter as the most charming season C its winter has a different charm D travelers can spend Christmas there Some airlines cut down their flight price in off seasons because A they hope to attract more travelers B they wish to show their gratitude to their passengers C their expenses are low during this time D they want to make up for the loss they have experienced D Looking up over the tops of her glasses Rosemary glanced at the kitchen clock it was almost a m My God Did the boy intend to sleep all day She noticed the pain in her wrist again and put down her pen Anyhow at years of age she was glad she could still write at all She had decided long ago that growing old was like slowly turning to stone you couldn t take anything for granted She stood up slowly painfully and started walking to the guest room The trip though only a distance of about feet seemed to take a long while Rosemary arrived at the door to the guest room It stood slightly open and she looked through the opening Victor lay sleeping on his side his arms bent his expression slightly pained Get up lazy bones she wanted to say Even in childhood Rosemary had never slept past a m there were too many chores to do How different things were for Victor s generation Her youngest grandson behaved as if he had never done a chore in his life Twenty one years old he had driven down to Florida to visit Rosemary in his shiny new car a gift from his dear parents Victor would finish college soon and his future appeared bright if he ever got out of bed that is Something Victor had said last night over dinner had disturbed her Now what was it Oh yes he had been talking about one of his college courses a gut he had called it When she had asked him to explain the word Victor had said it was a course that you took simply because it was easy to pass Rosemary who had not even had a high school education found the word unpleasant If she had been allowed to continue her studies she would never have taken a gut The memory flooded back then still painful as an open wound all these years later It was the first day of high school She had graduated from grammar school the previous year but her father had forbidden her to go to high school that autumn saying she was needed on the farm After much tearful begging she had gotten him to promise that next year she could start high school She had endured a whole year of chores instead of books with animals and rough farmhands for company instead of people of her own age But when the final day came her father was waiting for her as she came downstairs She was declined There was no arguing with Papa when he spoke that way Tearfully she had to drag herself upstairs to change clothes Rosemary still wondered what her life would have been like if her father had not been waiting at the bottom of the stairs that day or if somehow she had found the strength to disobey him Suddenly Victor moved slightly without waking and whispered something unintelligible Waken from her daydreaming Rosemary stared at Victor She wondered if he were having a nightmare By saying if he ever got out of bed Para Rosemary thought Victor was A too tired to get up B promising but lazy C impolite to oversleep D old enough to help with chores Why did Rosemary dislike Victor s use of the word gut A Because it showed that Victor didn t take education seriously B Because it reminded Rosemary of her grammar school classes C Because it indicated that college courses were too easy to pass D Because it implied that Rosemary was lacking in high school education Rosemary s memory of the day when she finally prepared to start high school indicates that A she had already decided to take up a job B she had hesitated over her choice of clothes C she had done especially well in grammar school D she had strongly desired to continue her education The passage as a whole is mainly about A whether Rosemary will go up to wake Victor up B Rosemary s struggle to keep painful memories C Rosemary s concern for Victor s study D whether Rosemary should fight for her schooling opportunity Guide to Time Management for Teens Some activities are more important than others but sometimes teens do not always assign an appropriate amount of time to the things that should be priorities in their lives Here we will give you some advice that can make your life easier Some teens like the structure of a schedule while others like to work out a list when they begin to better manage their time Go ahead and try different time management plans to find the one that works best for you Although it is certainly all right to allow yourself some leisure time you have to know when it is time to buckle down and get some work done Try breaking large projects down into more manageable parts Not only will you avoid procrastination by doing a little work each day but you will find that the work you get done will be of higher quality than if you had just rushed to put something together the night before Get and stay organized It is much

need to do Post sticky notes on the TV or the radio to remind you to limit the time you spend watching or listening to them When you have had a successful week reward yourself by spending the weekend with your friends or by doing whatever you enjoy most Every bit of progress will help you to make your stressful life more manageable A Find out where you are wasting time B Distraction is unavoidable

yourself to stick to your new time management goals G Schedules are a very good way to stay organized A B C D Do you ever feel like you are studying a mad rush of one subject after another When things happen at such a pace it is easy to lose sight of what you are learning It is important to every now and then to think about what you have been learning Self reflection means stopping the mad rush and yourself so that your brain can evaluate what it has already Some people prefer to do their self reflections while others keep a journal Either method can work depending on what your own personal is School textbooks are often divided into units This can make it for someone to begin the process of self reflection Watch for the times when you complete a unit of study Sometimes you are reminded that the unit is because there is some kind of test or quiz Use these natural as opportunities to stop and reflect You should find a place anywhere without noise is OK This can even be sitting at your desk at school when you finish something and the other students are still working If you are going to take notes take out your journal write down some notes on things that you learned in this unit Let your mind think about the notes you have written and make some Sometimes just pausing to think deeply allows your brain to make connections new information can quickly appear when you it again Next think about things that you still wonder about maybe you learned about a certain body system but you don t how it works with the other body systems Maybe you learned a new way to solve a math problem but you are not sure when to use it Writing down your will help you remember to continue seeking answers the next time your the same topic Self reflection is an essential skill for a student If you have

appreciation We love the idea within the gift rather than the thing Time flies This is a third year that I have been in this school In the past two and a half years our school had organized many activities That impressed me most was an activity called Learning to Farm In an autumn afternoon we were sent to a farm which we learned to plant potatoes Having been in the city for so a long time we were so happy to go to the countryside After divided into three groups we started to work Some students cut potatoes into pieces some dug holes and the others put the pieces of potatoes into the hole put the earth back and pushed them down hard We continued doing that until all the work was done Although we were exhausted but we felt fulfilled on our way back home Nowadays an increasing number of

works When we do study our language though we are often surprised that we are able to understand our conversations Words can mean so many different things However it turns out that the speaking situation helps a lot in making language work First the speaking situation helps make words more particular For example the word dog can describe a dog that a speaker saw in a dream It can also be used to discuss a neighbor s dog No language has a separate word for the idea dog that I saw yesterday and another word for the idea dog that I saw in a dream This is because the speaking situation makes it clear what speakers mean when they use words So when you have a conversation with your neighbor the knowledge that you have a dog tells your neighbor what the word dog probably means in that situation The speaking situation also helps make language clearer For example the word bank has two possible meanings It can mean a place where people keep money but it can also mean the side of a river So the sentence I went to the bank is not clear It could mean I went to the side of the river or it could mean I went to the place where my money is kept However if the speaker is talking about fishing or going to the mountains others probably know that bank means the side of a river The things that speakers say may not always be clear Sometimes the words are not very particular but the speaking situation can provide the meaning Other times words may have many meanings Then the speaking situation limits the right meaning This extra knowledge from the situation is very important to understand language The passage is mainly about A the best time and place to talk to others B how speaking situation helps language work C what to say in difficult situations D how our language works According to the passage we can safely say that A a speaking situation does not affect the meaning of words B speaking is not very natural for most people C a speaking situation is not important D people often do not consider how talking works By using the example of the word dog the writer wants to show that A a word may need to be explained in a conversation B a word may have different meanings C speaking situation helps people understand the particular meaning of a word D the meaning of words is not particular According to the passage we can know the meaning of the word bank by referring to A the time and the place where the conversation happens B the occupation of the person who uses the word C earlier or later parts of the conversation D a reliable dictionary B I turned on Friday but the Driver s License Office in my small hometown was only open on Tuesday so I had to wait through that extremely long weekend and an endless Monday before going in for my examination I came to the Driver s License Office half an hour earlier that Tuesday morning pacing back and forth on the worn porch waiting for the office to open at eight I reviewed the driver s manual for the hundredth time I was ready I knew the manual backward and forward I had made an A in my driver s training course and I was a genius behind the wheel Finally the door opened and a weary looking man in a brown uniform let me in Let me guess You want to take the driver s test his voice was not enthusiastic Yes I answered in excitement Ok fill this out and if you pass we ll go for a drive I grabbed the test and rushed to the desk where I filled it out in record time A quick check showed that my paper was perfect Let s get in the car He tossed me a set of keys and I slid behind the wheel Everything was going smoothly as we pulled out of the empty parking lot I signaled a right hand turn and we were on a deserted street This was going to be easy Turn left and go up Young Blood Hill he ordered My hometown is in the mountains and Young Blood Hill was almost vertical As I eased up the steep hill and came to a stop at the top I heard the car s engine die My heart sank I would have to start it again without rolling back down the hill I swallowed hard and turned the key as I moved my foot from the brake the car began to roll I suppose I could have rolled all the way back to the bottom except for one thing There was something behind me which stopped my roll with a rough shake and crash of glass a police car The policeman wrote me a ticket as I looked over the damage and the man from the Driver s License Office slid behind the wheel I waited until we had parked before I asked how long a person had to wait before taking the test again What time does that Tuesday morning in Paragraph refer to A The morning when he made an A in his driver s training course B The morning when he knew the driver s manual perfectly well C The first Tuesday morning immediately after his th birthday D The Tuesday morning right before his th birthday Why didn t the car roll back to the bottom A The engine died B It hit a police car C The writer braked it hard D The man from the Driver s License Office helped make it stop From the underlined sentence I grabbed the test and rushed to the desk where I filled it out in record time we can know that A the writer didn t like the man from

children and breastfeeding and a woman s risk of death Researchers analyzed data from women across countries including the UK France Germany and Sweden with an average age of Each woman was followed for an average of years During this period there were deaths overall which included deaths from cancer and deaths from circulatory system diseases according to the study The team compared reproductive factors with risk of death from several common conditions such as breast cancer stroke and heart disease The researchers found that women who had given birth had a percent reduced risk of death than those who had not It was also found that there was a reduced risk of death eight percent in women who had breastfed compared to those who did not The risk of death from cancer was lower in those that had given birth compared to those that had not Within this group the risk was reduced even further in women that gave birth to two or three children in comparison to those who had only one child

the laws of learning Space your learning Each session may take one half hour to an hour and a half depending on the amount of material and on your own speed of learning Do one or two sessions at a time three if you re going strong and are all involved and always decide when you stop and exactly when you will return Everyone learns at a different pace Fast learners are no better than slow learners it s the end result that counts not the time it takes you to finish Review When you start a new session go back to the last exercise of the previous session cover your answers and see how much you remember Test yourself You are not aiming for a grade or putting your worth on the line when you take the Comprehensive Tests You are deciding where repairs have to be made and especially you are experiencing a feeling of success at work that is well done Use these tests as well as the abundant drill exercises as aids to learning No one is perfect no one learns in the exact same way or at the same speed as anyone else And then give yourself every opportunity to exploit your actual latent and potential abilities But most important of all as I will remind you several times throughout this book develop a schedule and stick to it A Do you have quick recall after a day or you simply forget everything B This approach works better than any other method for learning words C On the contrary you are discovering your weaknesses if any D Every chapter of this book is divided into sessions E Real learning goes on only through active participation F Do not rush go at your own comfortable speed G Find the optimum technique and speed for your unique learning patterns A B C D Personally I think trains are exciting and romantic I must that trains are not important means of

ten years old I went with my elder sister to visit our cousins six hundred miles away The train so loud and violent on the outside was and rocking inside We were very excited and as that was also our first time away from our parents we felt somewhat frightened too However because I had so much I was a little disappointed when I was finally one of the passengers I had for so long As a college student I ride overnight train to my roommate s hometown We could never afford a so we played cards sang ate read and talked we finally fell uncomfortably asleep in the straight backed seats My idea that trains are may come from the fact that my husband and I took the train on our honeymoon spending extra money to eat in the dining car and the window as the desert scenery slid past Now when I make a trip I always fly or drive and are not a very important part of my life every time I hear the train whistle faraway on a quiet night I can always feel the in my heart to pack my bags and jump

There is growing concern about food insecurity in the developing world Rising food prices weather emergencies and political problems are deepening the struggle for families in many countries Three UN agencies have published a report recently saying high prices are likely to continue Gregory Barrow who is with the World Food Program in Rome says If you look at the places where the World Food Program works particularly in developing countries you see people who might be spending more than percent of their salary in purchasing food for their families East Africa is suffering its worst drought in years In Kenya at least three and a half million people are going hungry mostly in the north Yet food is going to waste in central Kenya Now farmers there want the government to buy their food and give it to those in need Farmers say bad roads and lack of transportation make it difficult for them to get their produce to the market Mr Barrow says It needs the government to make some arrangements such as providing transport They can buy it at a good price then give it to those people instead of asking for food from overseas which is very bad When we are throwing away food they are asking for food from overseas Economists say that imports reduce local food prices decrease productivity and increase the dependency on other countries Farmers in Kenya hope the government can pay higher prices for their crops so that they can feed more Kenyans What is the best title for this passage A Kenya Imports Food from Abroad B World Food Program in Rome C The Poor Suffer from High Food Prices D A Report Published by Three UN Agencies What do we know about Kenya from the passage A The people in central Kenya are suffering from hunger B At least three and a half million Kenyans lack

Kenya B Government officials C The farmers of central Kenya D Kenyan economists Which of the following statements is TRUE according to this passage A Gregory Barrow suggests that Kenya make good use of overseas food B People in northern Kenya are suffering the drought less than the central C Economists believe importing food from abroad may cause problems D Kenyan government hopes to buy the native crops at higher prices D Hunan Satellite TV is losing its leading position There s a reason for saying this In the reality talent show the Voice of China on the Zhejiang Television became the most popular program in China The reason for its popularity was really because of its excellent quality Or can we assume that without any opponent we can t tell a contestant is winning because he is really talented or because there is no comparison The administrative department really contributed a lot in the popularity of the Voice of China In the past there were no other draft shows ranked as high as Super Girl and Super Boy Even though there were some draft shows which seemed to share the popularity it never turned out true All the other draft shows were shadowed by the ones on Hunan TV One example was that since draft shows of Hunan TV were broadcast on Friday night the draft shows of other stations were shifted to Saturday or Sunday However Hunan TV didn t get their permission for broadcasting shows in And if this were not bad enough SARFT did a great favor for it SARFT issued a regulation saying that all draft shows should be broadcast after pm at night Zhejiang TV declared long before the regulation that since was no audition no PK no rise in rank no voting no champion its program was never a draft show So in all the opponents of Zhejiang TV had to broadcast their draft shows after pm while the Voice of China was permitted to be broadcast in prime time If you really think about it there s no essential difference between a draft show and the Voice of China It also selected people from all over the country how did they say this was different from a draft show No PK really PK doesn t mean one versus one A team versus a team is called PK too And no rise in rank is just a switch of concepts because at the end of every game some left the stage and some stayed If there was really no champion how come there was only one good voice of China at the final round All these were rising in rank in disguise Under such circumstances the Voice of China even got praise We are not saying that it is not a good show we are saying that there s regret about the show since it had no opponent The following factors are important in making the Voice of China popular EXCEPT A the unique quality of the voice of China B the policy support from SARFT and the administrative department C the favorable broadcasting time D the shortage of good opponents The passage mainly tells us A the voice of China is not a real draft show B the draft shows of Hunan Satellite TV still cause our attention C the advantages of the Voice of China D the reasons why Hunan Satellite TV is losing its leading position What s the author s attitude towards the voice of China A supportive B doubtful C optimistic D hopeful Which is TRUE according to the passage A SARFT issued a regulation saying that all draft shows should be broadcast after pm at night B Draft shows of Hunan TV were broadcast on Sunday night C In the past there were some draft shows ranked as high as Super Girl D The Voice of China is a program of Hunan Satellite TV Parents have started to notice many benefits associated with online math and reading tutoring services Both conventional and online tutoring offers children academic help Here s why Online tutoring much like conventional tutoring helps a student complete difficult assignments and is geared toward improving grades This method however allows your children to master their studies from the convenience of home making it more convenient for both children and parents who have a busy schedule Since the Internet is probably already one of your children s favorite activities working education programs into their online time is easier than convincing them to apply traditional face to face methods These abilities are essential in today s world Online tutoring also enables very individualized programs and plans Often people believe online tutoring is designed for the masses Beyond that they often accommodate your children s learning speed Not all children learn at the same rate and feeling rushed means that important lessons are not mastered Online tutoring eliminates that worry because children advance when they re ready not when a tutor suggests its time Students who are not self motivated may use study time for surfing the Internet Others need the more hands on learning approach offered by one on one sessions So how do you truly identify whether online tutoring is right for you and your child If this method is not effective contact a local tutor or tutoring center A The online method is increasing in popularity however B The only way is to give it a try C Online tutoring may not be for everyone however D

woman may go to choose a husband from many men The store consisted of floors and the men increase in positive attributes as the shopper goes up the flights There is however a catch As you open the door to any floor you may choose a man from that floor but if you go up a floor you cannot go back down except to exit the building So a woman goes to the shopping center to find a husband On the first floor the sign on the door reads Floor These men have jobs The woman reads the sign and says to herself Well that s better than my last boyfriend but I wonder what s further up So up she goes The second floor sign reads Floor These men have jobs and love kids The woman remarks to herself That s great but I wonder what s further up And up she goes again The third floor sign reads Floor These men have jobs love kids and are extremely good looking Hmm better The fourth floor sign reads Floor These men have jobs love kids are extremely good looking and help with the housework Wow exclaims the woman Very tempting But there must be more further up And again she heads up another flight The fifth floor sign reads Floor These men have jobs love kids are extremely good looking help

visitor to this floor There are no men on this floor Thank you for shopping Husband Mart and have a nice day Women tend to go up the floor until they reach the top floor because A they think the husbands downstairs are not suitable B they are sure that the best husbands are on the top floor C they think even better husbands may be upstairs D they know the catch very well The writer intends us

women are not good at shopping husbands B more women will leave the shop alone C women are romantic D women are more kind than men B Death is natural but do you have any idea of the process of dying

function but have not suffered permanent damage The organism can still be revived Biological death occurs when changes in the organism lead to the breaking up of vital cells and tissues Death is then unchangeable and final Scientists have been seeking a way to lengthen the period of clinical death so that the organism can remain alive before biological death occurs The best method developed so far involves cooling of the organism combined with narcotic sleep By slowing down the body s metabolism cooling delays the processes leading to biological death To illustrate how this works scientists performed an experiment on a six year old female monkey called Keta The scientist put Keta to sleep with a narcotic Then they surrounded her body with ice bags and began checking her body temperature When it had dropped to degrees the scientists began draining blood from an artery The monkey s blood pressure decreased and an hour later both the heart and breathing stopped clinical death set in For twenty minutes Keta remained in this state Her temperature dropped to degrees At this point the scientists pumped blood into an artery in the direction of the heart and started artificial breathing After two minutes Keta s heart became active once more After fifteen minutes spontaneous breathing began and after four hours Keta opened her eyes and lifted her head After six hours when the scientists tried to give her a penicillin injection Keta seized the syringe and ran with it around the room Her behavior differed little from that of a healthy animal For a person who suffers from the clinical death A he still has the possibility of getting back to life B his most important organs are damaged C he can not avoid final death D he is still very much alive Scientists try to make the time of clinical death longer in order to A slow down the body s metabolism B bring vital cells and tissues back to active life C delay the coming of biological death D cool the organism How did the scientists put Keta into clinical death A By surrounding her body with ice bags and draining her blood B By lowing her blood pressure and stopping her heart from beating C By draining her blood lowering her blood pressure and stopping her breathing D By putting her to sleep lowering her temperature and draining her blood All of the following indicate that the monkey has almost restored to her original physical state except the fact that A her heart beat again B she regained her normal breath C she rejected a penicillin injection D she acted as lively as a healthy monkey C OK I said to my daughter as she bent over her afternoon bowl of rice What s going on with you and your friend J J is the leader of a group of third graders at her camp a position Lucy herself occupied the previous summer Now she s the one on the outs and every day at snack time she tells me all about it while I offer the unhelpful advice all summer long She s fond of giving orders Lucy complained She s turning everyone against me She s mean And she s fat Excuse me I said struggling for calm What did you just say She s fat Lucy mumbled We re going upstairs I said my voice cold We re going to discuss this And up we went I d spent the nine years since her birth getting ready for this day the day we d have the conversation about this horrible word I knew exactly what to say to the girl on the receiving end of the teasing but in all of my imaginings it never once occurred to me that my daughter would be the one who used the F word Fat My daughter sat on her bed and I sat beside her How would you feel if someone made fun of you for something that wasn t your fault I began She could stop eating so much Lucy mumbled mouthing the simple advice a thousand doctors have given overweight women for years It s not always that easy I said Everyone s different in terms of how they treat food Lucy looked at me waiting for me to go on I opened my mouth then closed it Should I tell her that in teasing a woman s weight she s joined the long tradition of critics Should I tell her I didn t cry when someone posted my picture and commented I m sorry but aren t authors who write books marketed to young women supposed to be pretty Does she need to know now that life isn t fair I feel her eyes on me waiting for an answer I don t have Words are my tools Stories are my job It s possible she ll remember what I say forever and I have no idea what to say So I tell her the only thing I can come up with that is absolutely true I say to my daughter I love you and there is nothing you could ever do to make me not love you But I m disappointed in you right now There are plenty of reasons for not liking someone What she looks like isn t one of them Lucy nods tears on her cheeks I won t say that again she tells me and I pull her close pressing my nose against her hair As we sit there together I pray for her to be smart and strong I pray for her to find friends work she loves a partner who loves her And still always I pray that she will never struggle as I ve struggled that weight will never be her cross to bear She may not be able to use the word in our home but I can use in my head I pray that she will never get fat Why does the author want to discuss with Lucy A Because she wants to offer some other helpful advice B Because she is really shocked at Lucy s rudeness C Because she has prepared the conversation for nine years D Because she decides to tell Lucy a similar story of her own What does the author want to tell her daughter A It is not easy to take the doctors advice to eat less B People shouldn t complain because life is unfair C People shouldn t be blamed for their appearance D She herself was once laughed at for her appearance It can be inferred from the passage that A the author earns a living by writing stories B the author is a fat but good looking woman C the author will stop loving her daughter for what she said D the author s daughter agreed with her from the very beginning The author s attitude towards her daughter can be best described as A satisfied and friendly B indifferent but patient C loving but strict D unsatisfied and angry D Children s lives have changed greatly over the last years But do they have a happier childhood than you or I did It s difficult to look back on one s own childhood without some element of nostalgia I have four brothers and sisters and my memories are all about being with them playing board games on the living room floor or spending days in the street with the other neighborhood children racing up and down on our bikes or exploring the nearby woods My parents scarcely appear in these memories except as providers either of meals or of severe blame after some particularly risky adventure These days in the UK at least the nature of childhood has changed dramatically Firstly families are smaller It is common for both parents to work outside the home and there is the feeling that there just isn t time to bring up a large family or that no one could possibly afford to have more than one child As a result today s boys and girls spend much of their time alone Another major change is that youngsters today tend to spend a huge amount of their free time at home inside This is due to the fact that parents worry far more than they used to about real or imagined dangers so they wouldn t dream of letting their children play outside by themselves Finally the kind of toys children have and the way they play is totally different Computer and video games have replaced the board games and more interesting activities of my childhood The irony is that so many ways of playing games are called interactive The fact that you can play electronic games on your own further increases the sense of loneliness felt by many young people today Do these changes mean that children today have a less relaxing childhood than I had I personally believe that they do but perhaps every generation feels exactly the same What is the purpose of the direct question given in the first paragraph A To get people s attention and lead in the topic B To gather people s opinions on childhood C To show who the passage is written for D To compare the childhood lives of two generations Which is NOT a reason for the changes A Families are smaller today B Parents worried too much about their children C Toys can be played by children alone at home D It s too dangerous to play outside What has the writer focused on in the fourth paragraph A Young people today shouldn t play electronic games B Some games that young people play today aren t really good C Computer and video games have replaced the board games D Board games are much more interesting than computer games The writer s attitude towards the childhood changing is A approving B unconcerned C objective D optimistic Home on the Way People need homes Children assume their parents place as home Boarders call school home on weekdays Married couples work together to build new homes and travelers have no place to call home at least for a few nights Don t they have the right to a home Of course they do Some regular travelers take their own belongings like bed sheets pillowcases and family photos to make them feel like home no matter where they are Some stay for long periods in the same hotel and as a result become very familiar with service and attendants Furthermore driving a camping car during one s travels and sleeping in the vehicle at night is just like home only mobile And how about keeping relationships while in transit Some send letters and postcards or even photos Others may just call and say Hi just to let their friends know that they re still alive and well People find ways to keep in touch Making friends on the way helps travelers feel more or less at home Nowadays fewer people are working in their local towns so how do they develop a sense of belonging Whenever we step out of our local boundaries there is always another home waiting to be found we can make the place we stay home A Hostels provide a clean safe place to stay while you are travelling the world B Others may simply put some flowers by the hotel window to make things more homely C Backpackers in youth hostels may become very good friends even closer than siblings D So how about people who have to travel for extended periods of time E No matter where you go in the world hotels are there too F Some keep contact with their friends via Internet G Wherever we are with just a little bit of effort and imagination A B C D I had just picked up my new car a very beautiful automobile if you re into cars A few months later I was involved in an That new and very beautiful car was destroyed It was clearly not my The other guy was so busy on his cell phone that he went right through a red light and knocked into the passenger side of my car It was even because my niece was asleep on the back seat and her father my brother was in the front passenger seat He was not to say the least The police arrived and began taking statements I that my speed had been up to about kmph So you were going about kmph he said No I said I was doing about kmph I said Right so you were doing about kmph again he In a slightly tone because I felt I wasn t being heard I said No I was doing about kmph OK if that s you want it this time the officer simply replied I didn t it at the time but I was shooting myself in the foot My insurance company paid me for the damages to my car I totally missed the boat on the other driver s insurance company The city speed limit is km I getting percent less than I would have from the other guy s insurance company because I had I was doing km It suddenly me that the traffic policeman had been trying to help me out He hadn t about the kmph he had known about the insurance that I had not I thought about what had over and over again I might have carried on insisting that I told the but I could at least have said

D hardest A hear B learn C say D Think II Over the years I ve been teaching children about a simple powerful concept the ant philosophy I think everybody should study ants They have an amaze four part philosophy and here is the first part ants never quit That s a good philosophy If they re heading somewhere and you try to stop them they ll look for way They ll climb over they ll climb under and they ll climb around They never quit looking for a way to get where they suppose to go Second ants think winter all summer That s an important viewpoint You can t be so naive as to think summer will last forever So ants are gathering in their winter food in the middle of summer and make prepare for the long cold winter You ve got to think storms when it s fine You ve got to think rocks as you enjoy the sand and sun Think ahead The third part of the ant philosophy is that ants think summer all winter That is so important During the winter ants remind This won t last long We ll soon be out of here And on the first warm day the ants are out it turns cold again they ll dive back down but then they come out on the first warm day They can t wait to get out And here s the last part of the ant philosophy How much will ant gather during the summer to prepare for the winter All he possible can What an incredible philosophy you can learn from the ant philosophy is Never give up look ahead

castle to meet the promised bridegroom of the Baron s daughter An arrangement had been made between the Baron and an old nobleman of Bavaria Berton for a marriage between their children It would increase the importance of both families The initial plans had been made in the usual way the young people were engaged without having met each other and the date set for the wedding The young Count Von Altenburg had been recalled from the army and was on his way to the castle to meet his promised bride Messages had been received from Wurtzburg where he was accidentally delayed The messages indicated the day and time when he might be expected to arrive The castle was in a fever of preparation to provide him with a suitable welcome Anne had dressed with particular care Bertha and Wilda had selected her clothing and quarreled all morning about what she should wear The young lady had taken advantage of their arguments to wear exactly what she wanted and had chosen very well She looked as beautiful as any young bridegroom could wish for and the excitement made her look even lovelier The two aunts constantly directed her as single aunts usually take a great interest in the love affairs of others They were giving her the final instructions on how to behave what to say and how to greet her intended husband Hour by hour passed The sun which had been so warm over the rich forests of the Odenwald was now setting along the tops of the mountains The Baron went to the tallest tower in the castle to see if he could see any sign of the Count and his escorts Once he thought he saw them The sound of horns came floating up from the valley A party of men was seen far below riding slowly along the road It was a false alarm for when they reached the foot of the mountain they suddenly rode off in a different direction The sun by now had set and the bats began to fly about in the evening light It was getting dark and the only movement on the road was the occasional worker returning home What can best describe the bridegroom A He accepted his intended marriage arranged without his knowledge B He was eager to meet his intended wife so he retired from the army C He wouldn t have been welcomed by the bride had he arrived on time D He didn t like the marriage so purposely delayed going to the castle Which of the following descriptions best reflects the disappointed feeling of the Baron family A The sun was so warm over the rich forests of the Odenwald B The Baron went to the tallest tower to see if he could see any sign of the Count C The sound of horns came floating up from the valley D The sun had set and the bats began to fly about in the evening light What will the author most probably write about in the next paragraph s A What happened to the bride B What happened to the bridegroom C What happened to the Baron D What happened to the aunts B With the Tesla Roadster and other plug in electric vehicles hitting the road demand is growing for accessible refueling points to recharge them Carbon Day Automotive a Chicago based company has now demonstrated a solar powered recharging point known as the Solar Plug In Station which lets motorists easily charge their cars using electricity that has been produced without any environmental damage The Solar Plug In Station went on show in Chicago as part of the city s bid to host the Olympic Games According to Carbon Day Automotive the solar powered recharging station is part of the vital infrastructure required for electric vehicles in Chicago and was the focus of the previous visit by the International Olympic Committee These solar powered electricity points will be used daily by Chicago to fuel the city s electric vehicles with power from the sun By producing the electricity from pollution free solar cells the CO emissions are reduced to zero Solar energy and electric vehicles are a partnership that is one more step to reducing our dependence on foreign oil Coulomb Technologies recently developed the components required for individual recharging stations marketed as ChargePoint Networked Charging Stations Carbon Day Automotive is the Midwest distributor for the ChargePoint stations The Solar Plug In Station consists of giant solar panels that shade the tiny ChargePoint Networked Charging Station The solar panel is connected to an underground battery pack ready for everyday refueling Without these stations it would be like driving around in traditional cars without the availability of gas stations says Scott Emalfarb CEO at Carbon Day The day of true plug in electric vehicles will be here sooner than most people realize and the world needs to be ready to accommodate them The Solar Plug In Station was used as part of the bid to host the Olympics mainly because A it s a new idea and attracts people s attention B it s environmentally friendly C it makes up for the lack of electricity D it brings convenience to electric vehicle users We can learn from the passage that A the Solar Plug In Station has gone on show internationally B the Solar Plug In Station is likely to be put to use in C to recharge the electric vehicles sometimes takes a long time D Chicago is promoting the application of electric vehicles The passage implies that with the Solar Plug In Station becoming popular A more visitors will come to Chicago B the citizens in Chicago will go to work faster C more space for electric vehicles is needed D the cost of electric vehicles will be lower than traditional cars What would be the best title for the passage A Chicago Will Soon Be Full of Electric Vehicles B Chicago Calls on People to Buy Electric Vehicles C Chicago Fights for Its Bid to Host the Olympics D Chicago Shows Its Solarpowered Recharging Stations C Britain was once regarded as a society with class distinction Each class had unique characteristics In recent years many writers have begun to speak the decline of class and classless society in Britain And in modern day consumer society everyone is considered to be middle class But pronouncing the death of class is too early A recent wide ranging society of public opinion found percent of people still placing themselves in particular class percent agreed that class was still a vital part of British society and percent thought there were still sharp class differences Thus class may not be culturally and politically obvious yet it remains an important part of British society Britain seems to have a love of stratification One unchanging aspect of a British person s class position is accent The words a person speaks tell her or his class A study of British accents during s found that a voice sounding like a BBC newsreader was viewed as the most attractive voice Most people said this accent sounded educated and soft The accents placed at the bottom in this study on the other hand were regional city accents These accents were seen as common and ugly However a similar study of British accents in the US turned these results upside down and placed some regional accents as the most attractive and BBC English as the least This suggests that British attitudes towards accent have deep roots and are based on class prejudice In recent years however young upper middle class people in London have begun to adopt some regional accents in order to hide their class origins This is an indication of class becoming unnoticed However the pop song Common People puts forward the view that though a middle class person may want to live like common people they can never appreciate the reality of a working class life A recent study of public opinion shows that in modern Britain A most people belong to middle class B people regard themselves socially different C it is time to end class distinction D it is easy to recognize a person s class The underlined word stratification in Paragraph is closest in meaning to A variety B division C authority D qualification British attitudes towards accent A have a long tradition B are based on regional status C are shared by the Americans D have changed in recent years What is the main idea of the passage A The middle class is expanding B A person s accent reflects his class C Class is a key part of British society D Each class has unique characteristics D Your first home Laurence Yep wrote in his book The lost Garden will always be the one that you remember best I have been away from it for over twenty years but I still go back in my dreams For Yep whose father came from China home was an apartment and the family grocery store in a neighborhood of San Francisco It was there that he learned about patience hard work and getting along with neighbours Mr Brown Laurence Yep s high school English teacher often set high goals for his students He was the first person to encourage Yep to write The experience of that class changed the direction of Yep s life At the age of Yep published his first short story a sci fi fantasy He has since written many books and many kinds of books He has retold Chinese folk stories and written for the theater In nearly all these varied works Yep who is married to the children s book author Joanne Ryder has returned to questions he has been asking himself since childhood What does it mean to be Chinese and American Can one who belongs to two cultures ever feel at home anywhere When asked How has being of a Chinese by origin been important to you Laurence Yep replied As a child I wanted to be as American as possible Then in my early twenties I became very interested in my Chinese roots For years after that I thought that my function as a Chinese American writer was to act as a bridge between two cultures Now though I am not so sure that it is possible to join them together Compared with Asian culture American culture pays more attention to individuals and competition The two cultures pull in opposite directions So I see myself now as someone who will always be on the border between two cultures That works to my benefit as a writer because now quite fitting in helps me be a better observer According to Paragraph Laurence Yep A misses his first home very much B goes back to China from time to time C moved to San Francisco at an early age D once worked part time at a grocery store We may infer from Paragraph that Mr Brown A asked Laurence Yep to be a good observer B taught Laurence Yep the value of patience C helped Laurence Yep finish his first book D had high expectations of Laurence Yep The last paragraph is mainly about Laurence Yep s A childhood memories B varied writing styles C view of the two cultures D relationship with his family Which of the following best describes Laurence Yep s attitude to life A Learn to accept your own differences B Put the needs of others ahead of your own C Work hard and you will receive many benefits D Challenge others as you would wish to be challenged It may seem pretty stressful to take a math exam Even if you know the material you can still get the problem wrong Knowing how to go through your math test and check your work can save you from handing in a test full of mistakes that can be avoided Write it out You can also check a math problem by writing everything out on paper Writing out math problems reduces your chances of missing anything to the lowest possible level which is a common cause of incorrect answers Make sure your answers work by doing the opposite procedure of what your problem calls for including the answer you got the first time around In other words you would use the opposite of this addition problem subtraction to determine whether or not your answer is the correct one Plugging in You may find that a variable isn t good enough or have a problem where you have to solve for a variable This is the only real way to assure yourself that the answer you ve found is correct Check for a reasonable answer For example if you get an answer in the millions and you know it should be in the thousands you ve likely misplaced a point Go back through the work on your paper to make sure all of your formulas and calculations are correct If everything looks okay do the problem again and compare the result of the second try to what you ve got on the first try A Do the opposite B Correct the answers C Plug the variable in the equation to check it out D Therefore you ll improve your grades as well as your math skills E It also helps you to figure out everything after you have already finished the test F If the result of a problem seems to make no sense it indicates that the answer is incorrect G This helps you to know what information you have and what information you need to solve A B C D My husband and I insisted that our children were old enough to clean their rooms and make their beds But they thought My complaints even self justified shouting were always landing on ears Very often a whole hour s scolding would end with their into tears I felt very frustrated I realized I needed to my method of mothering One day when they were at school I spent some time their rooms On their desks in plain I left the cards Dear Bill the other card was to Sarah your room was messy this morning and I m sure you like it clean Love the Room Fairy arriving back the children were excited to receive the little note from the Room Fairy The next day their rooms were fairly tidy Sure enough there was another note from the Room Fairy for them thanking them for their nice gift of a clean room and asking them to play a certain violin Each day thank you notes would be written differently to keep the ideas Sometimes the Room Fairy would propose a little If you can finish your homework and your lessons before dinner I d like to watch a particular television program with you tonight Sometimes some colored markers or other little items would be left in of well done jobs the day I can t remember how long the Room Fairy continued leaving her love notes When they were age appropriate we used various versions of Post Its The bathroom mirror became the center of our home Appointments notices about visiting relatives lesson schedules and changes in plans could be posted We all benefited from and the idea of sharing reminders and daily details of life through notes I believe the true advantage of the Room Fairy notes survives in our frequent and enjoyable

soil and sow vegetable seeds it wasn t easy to grow enough food for everyone and in the first few years they faced starve Despite all hardships of those early years many of the migrants succeeded in building a good life for Within a reason short time some had established large sheep farms and began to export meat and wool back to England With most migrants correspond with their family we know a

so the man set out for the market He looked long and hard at the animals offered for sale before finally making an agreement with the owner of an expensive horse The man would buy the horse on one condition the owner had to allow the man to try out the animal before paying the money The owner was puzzled He had never heard of such a deal before but he agreed to the man s request The man walked the horse home and put him in the straw yard with his other horses He watched the animals to see how they would behave Almost immediately the new animal left the others and joined the laziest fattest

freedom it s the place where different cultures clash and live together in peace However you guys might agree with me it s not easy to leave home and the security of family friends and people who love and care about us And doing it raises some questions Is it worth it Are you equal to the challenge You might be sitting in front of your computer watching a documentary about America which shows you the breathtaking views of skyscrapers in New York the beautiful warm weather in San Diego and the huge parties along the beaches of the Sunshine State Florida Just as you know it s all true I remember how my heart was racing the first time I visited Times Square in New York I can t find any words in the dictionary to describe how I felt at that moment Someday when you get lucky and go there you will know what I mean Unfortunately TV and movies never show the other side of what students must do to survive America Education in the States is really different from other places Yes there is the traditional A B C and D grading system and you get to be on the Dean s List if you have all As on your transcript However these grades don t just come from your test performances The requirements of classes in the US are much more varied and this is the biggest adjustment that overseas students have to manage Some have papers that you have to write every week others have group projects you must do with your classmates presentations you make in the class or research you do by yourself to prove your own idea There comes a night when you have a couple of projects for different classes a paper and an exam to study for And that night you ask yourself What did I get myself into I m not trying to intimidate you but you should know what it really is like to study in the States One thing I can promise you is that it is worth all the hard work you put in And the more time you give to your study the more open doors you will have by the time you finish your degree The author wrote this passage to A help readers prepare for studying in the US B warn people of the dangers of living in the US C promote the US education system to overseas students D make readers understand the benefits of studying in the US According to the author America is A a place that he could not get used to B a country where students can learn freely C a dangerous place to live in without family or friends D a place where people from different backgrounds get on well When the author first visited Times Square he felt A disappointed B surprised C excited D nervous According to the passage which of the following is most challenging A Attending all the classes B Getting all As in the tests C Writing papers every week D Balancing different study requirements C If you see a group of people dancing and singing on the street or in the railway station you don t need to feel surprised They are a flash mob Who are they Are they mobs Don t be confused by their name Actually a flash mob is a group of people who gather suddenly in a public place do something unusual for a brief period of time and then quickly disappear They are usually organized with the help of the Internet or other digital communications networks The messages may be sent to friends who send to more people At a predetermined time they gather and perform some activities such as exchanging books coming together to look at the sky waving their hands and yelling something at the top of their voice for seconds Then they quickly disappear before the police can arrive Using mobile phones the flash mob can change its place if the first one has been cancelled for any reason Bill Wasik senior editor of Harper s Magazine organized the first flash mob in Manhattan in May and the first successful flash mob gathered on June Wasik claimed that he created the flash mob as a social experiment designed to laugh at fashion seekers and stress the cultural atmosphere of wanting to be an insider or part of the next big thing Flash mob gatherings can sometimes shock people Such an activity might seem amusing and magical but it also might frighten people who are not aware of what is taking place Undoubtedly flash mob can serve as good political tools and have great potential such as using flash mob to advertise a product The flash mob is now becoming more and more popular People use it to do many things For example in Michael Jackson s fans took part in a flash mob to remember him Hundreds of his fans gathered singing and dancing Michael s famous song Beat It together Flash mobs give people from all walks of life an opportunity to come together to create a memory What is NOT the feature of the flash mob A It can get together quickly B It can change its place freely C It can do activities suddenly D It can injure people seriously How do flash mobs inform one another By using the Internet By writing letters By yelling By waving hands By using mobile phones By holding a meeting A B C D Why did Bill Wasik create the flash mob A To advertise some products B To help people make friends C To make fun of fashion seekers D To create some memories What can we learn about the flash mob from the passage A Bill Wasik organized the first successful flash mob in May B People are encouraged to take a more active part in an activity C Flash mobs tend to do something illegal for a short time D Flash mob gathering can frighten all the people present D If women are mercilessly exploited year after year they have only themselves to blame Because they feel upset at the thought of being seen in public in clothes that are out of fashion they are always taken advantage of by the designers and the big stores Clothes which have been worn only a few times have to be put aside because of the change of fashion When you come to think of it only a woman is capable of standing in front of a wardrobe packed full of clothes and announcing sadly that she has nothing to wear Changing fashions are nothing more than the intentional creation of waste Many women spend vast sums of money each year to replace clothes that have hardly been worn Women who cannot afford to throw away clothing in this way waste hours of their time doing with the dresses they have Skirts are lengthened or shortened necklines are lowered or raised and so on No one can claim that the fashion industry contributes anything really important to society Fashion designers are rarely concerned with vital things like warmth comfort and durability They are only interested in outward appearance and they take advantage of the fact that women will put up with any amount of discomfort as long as they look right There can hardly be a man who hasn t at some time in his life smiled at the sight of a woman shaking in a thin dress on a winter day or picking her way through deep snow in high heeled shoes When comparing men and women in the matter of fashion the conclusions to be drawn are obvious Do the constantly changing fashions of women s clothes reflect basic qualities of inconstancy and instability Men are too clever to let themselves be cheated by fashion designers Do their unchanging styles of dress reflect basic qualities of stability and reliability That is for you to decide Designers and big stores always make money A by mercilessly exploiting women workers in the clothing industry B because they are capable of predicting new fashions C by constantly changing the fashions in women s clothing D because they attach great importance to quality in women s clothing The writer would be less critical if fashion designers placed more stress on the of clothing A cost B appearance C comfort D suitability According to the passage which of the following statements is TRUE A New fashions in clothing are created for the commercial exploitation of women B The constant changes in women s clothing reflect their strength of character C The fashion industry makes an important contribution to society D Fashion designs should not be encouraged since they are only welcomed by women By saying the conclusions to be drawn are obvious Lines Para the writer means that A women s inconstancy in their choice of clothing is often laughed at B women are better able to put up with discomfort C men are also exploited greatly by fashion designers D men are more stable and reliable in character You can help your firm innovate by creating a culture in which all employees are actively encouraged to put forward ideas But how do you get the best from people and encourage them to be at their most creative Stress the importance of creativity If they don t understand innovation can keep your firm competitive your efforts at encouraging creative thinking risk falling flat Make time for brainstorming Find some time for new ideas to come out For example set aside time for brainstorming hold regular group works hops and arrange team days out A team involved in a brainstorming session is likely to be more effective You should also give individuals the space to reflect privately on their work if you think they need it Challenge the way staff work Ask people whether they have considered alternative ways of working and what might be achieved by doing things differently Motivate individuals or teams who come up with winning ideas by actively recognizing creativity for example through an award scheme You can reward those who just have a rich flow of suggestions regardless of whether they are put into action at work Act on ideas Creative thinking is only worthwhile if it results in action Provide the time and resources to develop and carry out those ideas worth acting on In addition the flow of ideas may well dry up if staff feel the process is pointless A Reward creativity B The problem is that our minds are lazy C Be willing to make mistakes D Make sure all your employees know that you want to hear their ideas E Individuals within the team can test and improve the ideas together F Encourage employees to keep looking at the way they approach their work G Failure to do so means that your firm may fail to benefit from innovation A B C D Once long ago there was a man who traveled

business or job Even when experience tells them that it s not and they know there s little hope of improvement they still because they don t want to waste the initial investment But this is It is no

Just weeks after a special memorial voyage to mark the th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic an Australian billionaire has announced plans to build an exact replica of the Titanic which is just as similar to the original one as possible The Titanic replica will make its first voyage from Southampton England to New York in The Titanic is a famous ship that sank in The attractive story of the ocean liner has made millions of people interested in it around the world It was believed to be an unsinkable ship but it hit an iceberg and sank on its first voyage More than people died in the sinking of the Titanic which at the time was the world s largest and most luxurious ocean liner When fully built the Titanic II will be meters feet long and capable of holding passengers Unlike the original Titanic which was powered by coal fired boiler and steam engines the Titanic II will have modern diesel and electric engines Also unlike the first Titanic the Titanic II will have more than enough lifeboats to accommodate everyone on board if something should go wrong When asked whether the new replica would sink Mr Palmer replied Of course it will sink if you put a hole in it He also added It will be designed as a modern ship with all the technology to ensure that doesn t happen When Mr Palmer was asked if he expected his Titanic to be successful he simply said At my age you don t really worry so much about whether you ll make money or lose money on something but I believe that it is worth building it Why is the Titanic replica being built A To make a voyage from Southampton England to New York B To mark the th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic C To realize Mr Palmer s dream of constructing a luxurious ocean liner D Not clearly talked about in the passage What s mainly talked about in Paragraph A The travelling route of the Titanic B A short introduction to the original Titanic C The number of people on the Titanic when it sank D People s great interest in the attractive story of the ocean liner What is the difference between the Titanic II and the original one A Titanic II will be powered by modern diesel and electric engines B The appearance of Titanic II will be more luxurious C The construction of Titanic II will be more complex D The number of the lifeboats on Titanic II will be smaller What is Mr Palmer s attitude towards his Titanic II replica A It will sink with a hole in it B It will definitely be a great success C It is worthwhile to build it D It will make him lose money B Today s children are the result of the modern society Our parents have jobs that keep them busy almost all day long They only have a free day in a week This doesn t allow them to keep an eye on their children On the other hand the modern society gives more freedom to the children than they could handle As a child you don t know how to grow up by yourself until you reach a certain age That is why you need school and parents to be by your side all the time If you don t have either of them you may make a lot of mistakes The social system of the modem society is very lenient especially with the children Most of the children today are rebels They are rude They are given too much freedom by their families This is their parents mistake They ought to know that the freedom they give to their children is misunderstood For example it is a bad thing for a year old child to go out in the evening on weekends Parents are also guilty of the way their children show up in the street or at school The same guilt belongs to the teaching system as well Pupils shouldn t be allowed to dress like they were on a fashion presentation at school Another important fact we can think of regarding the freedom of children is their free will of spending money Parents shouldn t allow their children to spend money on whatever they want I think children are given too much freedom not only by their parents but also by the society The latter is more to be blamed The writer implies that parents busy lifestyle A makes their children become independent B may lead to a tense parent child relationship C is harmful to their children s health D is likely to create a troubled generation What does the underlined word lenient in Paragraph mean A Not responsible B Not strict C Unkind D Unfair It seems that the writer agrees that students A should stay at

primary responsibility for children s problems A The social environment B The educational system C Each family D The school C Online Money Earning Yes you can earn money online without any investment

the time they will study and they set goals for what will be achieved If you want to be successful do as successful people do Set a plan and set a goal and stick to it which will create a routine and a routine is the first step towards developing a habit Front Up To The Toughest Work First Many of us like to do the easy things first to build our confidence That s fair enough The only challenge with this approach is that you use up your primary energy at the start of any study period and so if you are dealing with the easy parts with your primary energy your batteries will be low when it comes the time to deal with the hard part So what happens then We all do it We really shouldn t though So develop the habit of giving your primary energy to the hard tasks and completing the easy stuff last Do we really have to explain this Just turn them off for an hour we promise the world will still be there when you log back in Don t text your friends don t chat while doing memory activities don t make phone calls just focus on what you re doing Even if you focus on work for minutes followed by mins of chatting it s better than minutes of work while also chatting You get that

a red phone box into a library a few years before Now the phone box is one of the country s smaller libraries About books placed on shelves in the phone box Villagers there can take whatever they want and leave their own books for exchange They can use the library around a clock so it opens days a year and hours a day Since the library opens its bright door people from all parts of the village have

or parents Pressure has much to do with the result of our studies Too much pressure has a bad effect on our studies while a proper amount of it may help push us ahead Whenever I m faced with too much pressure I choose to do some sports or listen to some music which is quite beneficial to me As for the effective way to let go of pressure I strongly recommend that when we feel much too stressed we

distributing meals to homeless people for their wedding reception on the border town of Kilis The couple had decided that instead of hosting their friends and family for a traditional feast reception they would feed the victims from an earthquake stricken area The idea came from the bridegroom s father Ted who volunteers for a Turkish relief organization For the past few years the organization has distributed daily meals to thousands of people who ve suffered from natural disasters He approached a representative of the organization and suggested that the family cover part of the costs of feeding them for the day Then he told his son who was surprised by the suggestion but soon won over When he told that to the bride she was really shocked but finally accepted because in southeastern Turkey there is a real culture of sharing with people in need They love to share their food their table and everything they have And afterwards she was quite amazed about it So they arrived at the distribution center on Thursday to spend the day serving food and taking photographs with their grateful recipients On Tuesday evening the newly married couple were still pleased with their decision to quit a personal celebration for one with a greater good It s like sharing a dinner with your friends and family who have this kind of thing on a daily basis or sharing something with people who don t even have the most basic things Michael said Hopefully this will also give the start for other wedding dinners to be held here with our brothers and sisters in need Why did so many people crowd in Kilis A To attend Michael and Linda s wedding B To support the organization C To escape the damaging earthquake D To help distribute free daily meals How did the couple celebrate their wedding A They

grateful victims What does the underlined word approached in Paragraph mean A took in B moved towards C came across D consulted with We can know from the text that A Kilis is a place which lies in southeastern Turkey B Ted was a representative of the organization C Linda adopted the suggestion immediately she heard it D Michael doubted if more new couples would follow him B Most book reviews start with a heading that includes all the basic information about the book like Title Author Place of publication publisher date of publication Number of pages Like most pieces of writing the review usually begins with an introduction that lets your readers know what the review will say The first paragraph usually includes the author and title again so your readers don t have to look up to find this information You should also include a very brief description of the contents of the book the purpose or audience for the book and your reaction and evaluation Then you move into a section of background information that helps place the book in context and discusses criteria for judging the book Next the review gives a summary of the main points of the book quoting and explaining key phrases from the author Finally you get to the heart of your review your evaluation of the book In this section you might discuss some of the following issues how well the book has achieved its goal what possibilities are suggested by the book what the book has left out how the book compares with others on the subject what specific points are not convincing what personal experiences you ve had related to the subject It is important to use labels to carefully distinguish your views from the author s so that you don t confuse your reader Then like other essays you can end with a direct comment on the book and tie together issues raised in the review in a conclusion There is of course no set form but a general rule is that the first one half to two thirds of the review should summarize the author s main ideas and at least one third should evaluate the book What is the most important part of a book review A The heading B The evaluation C The conclusion D The introduction It can be confusing to readers if A there is no heading in a book review B the book has achieved its goal C the viewer s point of view is not distinguished from the author s D the book is compared with others on the same subject What is NOT suggested for a book review in this passage A Quoting from the author of the book B Providing some book information C Analyzing only the author of the book D Comparing the book with others of a similar subject The best title for this passage is A Steps to follow B Tips for writing a book review C The way to develop your idea D Things not to be avoided in a book review C The expression a thirst for knowledge may soon have a new meaning for millions of people who have no way to get clean water Researchers have developed a book with specially treated pages that can turn dirty water into clean and drinkable water They say their invention could improve the lives of many in the developing world About million people around the world are at risk of disease or even death because their drinking water is not clean The water is polluted by harmful bacteria The book contains pages Each page is about one millimeter thick The pages contain very small particles of silver The pages can be used as filters to remove harmful microorganisms that can pollute drinking water The filter kills the organisms that pass through it Pictures on the pages show the dangers of dirty water and how to use the book for those unable to read The pages are made of filter paper They are designed to be torn from the book Water can be poured through the paper to be cleaned Ms Dankovich the inventor says each page can treat up to liters of water She recently presented her invention at the meeting of the American Chemical Society in Boston Massachusetts She was asked whether she had considered adding classic literature on the book s pages The idea of classic texts that s of interest maybe later We have discussed a little bit more exciting text But we really haven t had the time to go through that part she says Teri Dankovich and another researcher tested the drinkable book in Bangladesh Ghana and South Africa The tests proved to be successful Water for Life a non governmental organization has provided financial support for the project What do we learn about the book from the text A It sells well around the world B It has pages with several functions C It is about environment protection D It can treat about liters of water What does the underlined phrase that part in Paragraph refer to A Classic texts B Invention presentation C Exciting discussion D Financial support In which country did not the researchers test the drinkable book A Bangladesh B Ghana C South Africa D America What is the main idea of the passage A Researchers have found a way to save those being ill B Millions of people are in great need of drinkable water C Book pages could provide safe drinking water D Knowledge is as important as drinkable water D Love to sink into your chairs and relax when you get to school Then you will not be happy to hear that schools all over the world are seriously considering exchanging traditional desks for ones with no seats at all Yes that means you will be encouraged to stand through those already too long math and science lessons Why would anyone even think of putting kids to such cruelty Experts say it improves their health and helps fight obesity While that may seem a little far fetched the officials at the few schools around the world seem to agree Among them are educators from the College Station Independent School District in Texas who recently completed a week long experiment involving students across three elementary schools The kids that agreed to participate in the study were provided with a device that helped record step count and calorie consumption over the entire period All teachers involved in the study reported that students appeared to be more alert and concentrate better when allowed to stand The one thing that did surprise the researchers was that younger kids were more willing to stay standing than kids in higher grades They believe this may have something to do with the fact that after years of being asked to sit still older kids have a harder time adjusting to this unexpected freedom American schools are not the only ones reporting success with stand up desks Four Catholic schools in Perth Australia which have been testing them since October have seen similar results In May Grove House Primary School in Bradford West Yorkshire became Europe s first test one with a seven week trial that involved the use of desks made by Ergotron in their fifth grade classrooms While official results are not out yet early reactions from both teachers and students have been extremely encouraging The findings of these studies and others done previously all seem to mean that allowing kids to move around in classrooms is a win win for students and teachers it helps kids get healthier and provides educators with a more engaged audience According to the teachers older students may not like stand up desks because A they are cleverer than younger students B they are easily tired of standing long C they have formed the habit of sitting D they do badly in class while standing What is most likely to be the result of the seven week trial A The standing desks can t be used at all B It is good for students to use stand up desks C More tests should be done in other schools D The students are different in personality Why do the teachers like the standing desks A Because the educators can draw the students attention B Because the teachers can keep the students healthy C Because the students can have a walk in the classroom D Because the standing desks can keep the students concentrated Sometimes they try to get out of a class to escape a teacher they don t like Here is some advice to solve this problem Ask yourself What can I learn from this teacher Even if you don t worship his or her personality or lectures dig deep until you find a subject in which he or she is very knowledgeable Focus on that part of the teacher s personality and use him or her as a tool for learning Not only will you gain more knowledge in that subject but a closer relationship with your teacher may help you understand one another better Talk to students who are doing well in the class and ask them for tips tools and a plan of action to get along with the teacher better If you still can t get along make an appointment with the school guidance counselor He or she will offer many tips and suggestions for you to get out of difficult teacher relationships That means they can help you and your teachers get rid of the bad impression on each other Your parents can meet with your teacher and try to work it out Teachers are there for more than just homework and they know about more than just their subject matter They can help you learn how to function as an adult and a lifelong learner Undoubtedly these will be a few teachers along the way who you will always remember and who might change your life forever A If your relationship problems can t be solved in school then it s time to tell your parents or guardians B If you re too shy to talk to another student study his or her actions and behavior in the classroom and try to follow that lead C Students don t always get along well with their teachers D There must be something good in every teacher for you to learn from E Students find it easy to get along well with their teachers F Sometimes a guidance counselor can act as a mediator between you and the teacher G Guidance counselors have the right to blame teachers A B C D I failed to protect you That was the message posted online by Du Yijun s boy friend He was with the

In Shanghai authorities have reacted to the Bund tragedy by cancelling or scaling back big events But this isn t really necessary Better planning and better crowd can ensure safe celebrations if you

it in America There is an undeniable excitement about coming to study in the US but it s not all excitement Yes it is America it is the land of freedom it s the place where different cultures clash and live together in peace However you guys might agree with me it s not easy to leave home and the security of family friends and people who love and care about us And doing it raises some questions Is it worth it Are you equal to the challenge You might be sitting in front of your computer watching a documentary about America which shows you the breathtaking views of skyscrapers in New York the beautiful warm weather in San Diego and the huge parties along the beaches of the Sunshine State Florida Just as you know it s all true I remember how my heart was racing the first time I visited Times Square in New York I can t find any words in the dictionary to describe how I felt at that moment Someday when you get lucky and go there you will know what I mean Unfortunately TV and movies never show the other side of what students must do to survive America Education in the States is really different from other places Yes there is the traditional A B C and D grading system and you get to be on the Dean s List if you have all As on your transcript However these grades don t just come from your test performances The requirements of classes in the US are much more varied and this is the biggest adjustment that overseas students have to manage Some have papers that you have to write every week others have group projects you must do with your classmates presentations you make in the class or research you do by yourself to prove your own idea There comes a night when you have a couple of projects for different classes a paper and an exam to study for And that night you ask yourself What did I get myself into I m not trying to intimidate you but you should know what it really is like to study in the States One thing I can promise you is that it is worth all the hard work you put in And the more time you give to your study the more open doors you will have by the time you finish your degree The author wrote this passage to A help readers prepare for studying in the US B warn people of the dangers of living in the US C promote the US education system to overseas students D make readers understand the benefits of studying in the US According to the author America is A a place that he could not get used to B a country where students can learn freely C a dangerous place to live in without family or friends D a place where people from different backgrounds get on well When the author first visited Times Square he felt A disappointed B surprised C excited D nervous According to the passage which of the following is most challenging A Attending all the classes B Getting all As in the tests C Writing papers every week D Balancing different study requirements C If you see a group of people dancing and singing on the street or in the railway station you don t need to feel surprised They are a flash mob Who are they Are they mobs Don t be confused by their name Actually a flash mob is a group of people who gather suddenly in a public place do something unusual for a brief period of time and then quickly disappear They are usually organized with the help of the Internet or other digital communications networks The messages may be sent to friends who send to more people At a predetermined time they gather and perform some activities such as exchanging books coming together to look at the sky waving their hands and yelling something at the top of their voice for seconds Then they quickly disappear before the police can arrive Using mobile phones the flash mob can change its place if the first one has been cancelled for any reason Bill Wasik senior editor of Harper s Magazine organized the first flash mob in Manhattan in May and the first successful flash mob gathered on June Wasik claimed that he created the flash mob as a social experiment designed to laugh at fashion seekers and stress the cultural atmosphere of wanting to be an insider or part of the next big thing Flash mob gatherings can sometimes shock people Such an activity might seem amusing and magical but it also might frighten people who are not aware of what is taking place Undoubtedly flash mob can serve as good political tools and have great potential such as using flash mob to advertise a product The flash mob is now becoming more and more popular People use it to do many things For example in Michael Jackson s fans took part in a flash mob to remember him Hundreds of his fans gathered singing and dancing Michael s famous song Beat It together Flash mobs give people from all walks of life an opportunity to come together to create a memory What is NOT the feature of the flash mob A It can get together quickly B It can change its place freely C It can do activities suddenly D It can injure people seriously How do flash mobs inform one another By using the Internet By writing letters By yelling By waving hands By using mobile phones By holding a meeting A B C D Why did Bill Wasik create the flash mob A To advertise some products B To help people make friends C To make fun of fashion seekers D To create some memories What can we learn about the flash mob from the passage A Bill Wasik organized the first successful flash mob in May B People are encouraged to take a more active part in an activity C Flash mobs tend to do something illegal for a short time D Flash mob gathering can frighten all the people present D If women are mercilessly exploited year after year they have only themselves to blame Because they feel upset at the thought of being seen in public in clothes that are out of fashion they are always taken advantage of by the designers and the big stores Clothes which have been worn only a few times have to be put aside because of the change of fashion When you come to think of it only a woman is capable of standing in front of a wardrobe packed full of clothes and announcing sadly that she has nothing to wear Changing fashions are nothing more than the intentional creation of waste Many women spend vast sums of money each year to replace clothes that have hardly been worn Women who cannot afford to throw away clothing in this way waste hours of their time doing with the dresses they have Skirts are lengthened or shortened necklines are lowered or raised and so on No one can claim that the fashion industry contributes anything really important to society Fashion designers are rarely concerned with vital things like warmth comfort and durability They are only interested in outward appearance and they take advantage of the fact that women will put up with any amount of discomfort as long as they look right There can hardly be a man who hasn t at some time in his life smiled at the sight of a woman shaking in a thin dress on a winter day or picking her way through deep snow in high heeled shoes When comparing men and women in the matter of fashion the conclusions to be drawn are obvious Do the constantly changing fashions of women s clothes reflect basic qualities of inconstancy and instability Men are too clever to let themselves be cheated by fashion designers Do their unchanging styles of dress reflect basic qualities of stability and reliability That is for you to decide Designers and big stores always make money A by mercilessly exploiting women workers in the clothing industry B because they are capable of predicting new fashions C by constantly changing the fashions in women s clothing D because they attach great importance to quality in women s clothing The writer would be less critical if fashion designers placed more stress on the of clothing A cost B appearance C comfort D suitability According to the passage which of the following statements is TRUE A New fashions in clothing are created for the commercial exploitation of women B The constant changes in women s clothing reflect their strength of character C The fashion industry makes an important contribution to society D Fashion designs should not be encouraged since they are only welcomed by women By saying the conclusions to be drawn are obvious Lines Para the writer means that A women s inconstancy in their choice of clothing is often laughed at B women are better able to put up with discomfort C men are also exploited greatly by fashion designers D men are more stable and reliable in character You can help your firm innovate by creating a culture in which all employees are actively encouraged to put forward ideas But how do you get the best from people and encourage them to be at their most creative Stress the importance of creativity If they don t understand innovation can keep your firm competitive your efforts at encouraging creative thinking risk falling flat Make time for brainstorming Find some time for new ideas to come out For example set aside time for brainstorming hold regular group works hops and arrange team days out A team involved in a brainstorming session is likely to be more effective You should also give individuals the space to reflect privately on their work if you think they need it Challenge the way staff work Ask people whether they have considered alternative ways of working and what might be achieved by doing things differently Motivate individuals or teams who come up with winning ideas by actively recognizing creativity for example through an award scheme You can reward those who just have a rich flow of suggestions regardless of whether they are put into action at work Act on ideas Creative thinking is only worthwhile if it results in action Provide the time and resources to develop and carry out those ideas worth acting on In addition the flow of ideas may well dry up if staff feel the process is pointless A Reward creativity B The problem is that our minds are lazy C Be willing to make mistakes D Make sure all your employees know that you want to hear their ideas E Individuals within the team can test and improve the ideas together F Encourage employees to keep looking at the way they approach their work G Failure to do so means that your firm may fail to benefit from innovation A B C D Once long ago there was a man who traveled from Persia to India on foot He had been to India before When he arrived at a village he happened upon a fruit stand In that village fruit was quite because of the lack of water The man was looking around at the fruits when he a big basket of

use them as a condiment You don t just eat them by the handful like that they re not fruit But the man replied No I can t I paid money for them and now I ll eat them It s my money You probably think this man was pretty right Nevertheless I bet you or someone you know makes the same on a daily basis People invest money time and effort into a relationship business or job Even when experience tells them that it s not and they know there s little hope of improvement they still because they don t want to waste the initial investment But this is It is no different than being the man who continued

Alexandra Scott was born to Liz and Jay Scott in Manchester Connecticut on January the second of four children Shortly before her first birthday Alex was diagnosed with neuroblastoma a type of childhood cancer On her first birthday the doctors informed Alex s parents that if she beat her cancer it was doubtful that she would ever walk again Just two weeks later Alex slightly moved her leg at her parents request to kick This was the first indication that she would turn out to be a courageous and confident child with big dreams and big accomplishments By her second birthday Alex was able to stand up with leg braces She worked hard to gain strength and to learn how to walk She appeared to be overcoming the difficulties until the shocking discovery within the next year that her tumors had started growing again In the year the day after her fourth birthday Alex received a stem cell transplant and informed her mother When I get out of the hospital I want to have a lemonade stand She said she wanted to give the money to doctors to allow them to help other kids like they helped me True to her word she held her first lemonade stand later that year with the help of her older brother and raised an amazing for her hospital People from all over the world moved by her story held their own lemonade stands and donated the earnings to Alex and her cause In August of Alex passed away at the age of knowing that with the help of others she had raised more than million to help find a cure for the disease that took her life Alex s family including brothers Patrick Eddie and Joey and

many years machines have been doing work that people once did including some difficult jobs Search and rescue operations in dangerous environments are often seen as the first areas that will employ high technology robots But there is another area where they may soon take jobs traditionally held by human beings the restaurant industry Teams from around the world competed in early June at the DARPA Robotic Challenge Finals in California A team from South Korea and its robot called DRC Hubo won the first place in the competition The second and third place winners were from the United States The robots were required to drive a vehicle climb up steps and do mechanical work Such activities are easy for humans to perform but more difficult for machines Not all of the competitors were successful The failures showed how difficult it is to design effective walking machines Akihiro Suzuki works at Yaskawa Electric a company that develops robots He says robots cannot do everything a human can but they are able to work without becoming tired He says robots cannot taste food change heating levels or seasonings to get the best flavor But he says if a food can be easily prepared a robot can repeat the same movement to reproduce the same meal One Japanese woman who saw the robots working wanted to bring them home Masayo Moti says she would like to have a husband who could work like a robot Suzumo Machinery showed its sushi maker robot It performs the often difficult work of wrapping the popular Japanese food Hiroshi Monden is an official with the company He says people all over the world now eat sushi but there are not enough skilled workers to prepare it He says his machine can help anyone make sushi In Paragraph the author tells us A robots just do difficult jobs B

applied at home B Preparing food is really difficult for robots C Their robots can just repeat the same movement D They failed to design effective walking robots We can infer from the last paragraph

Education B Culture C Health D Science D The age at which kids first fall victim to bullying could influence how strongly they are affected suggests a new study And surprisingly it is not the youngest kids who are hurt the most in the long term Bullying can have long lasting effects but particularly when it begins in adolescence the researchers say People subjected to either verbal or physical bullying are known to be at greater risk of developing depression anxiety disorders or to behave violently But not everyone reacts in this way Children bullied for the first time before they hit adolescence seem to get over it but those who are bullied for the first time later on in adolescence seem to become more aggressive or are more likely to turn to drink as a means of coping These are the conclusions of psychologist Matthew Newman and colleagues from the University of Texas at Austin US The team gave questionnaires to nearly college students regarding their experience of physical and psychological bullying before adolescence before high school and in late adolescence at high school They assessed mood and mental state judging by signs of anxiety or depression such as sleeplessness The group was also questioned about how they would react to certain challenges such as humiliation People who were bullied all revealed slightly higher levels of stress But while those bullied earlier in life seemed to respond normally to provocation people bullied for the first time late in adolescence are more withdrawn and sensitive to violence There are also sex differences between those bullied for the first time during adolescence with females more likely to react aggressively when provoked and males are much more likely to turn to alcohol to escape bad situations The best solution in all cases was strong social support whether from friends family or school Those with no one to share their problems with suffered the most So perhaps it is best not to shelter children completely from bullying early on suggests Newman They may get stressed but unhealthy coping really jumps out when they are bullied for the first time later on What determines the degree of bullying s effect on people according to the study A The reason why they are bullied B The place where they are first bullied C The age at which they are first bullied D The person who first bullies them What may happen to those first bullied later on in adolescence according to Newman and his colleagues A Some are likely to be more aggressive B They seem to easily get over the effect of bullying C Most of them will respond to bullying normally D Most of them are afraid of sharing their problems What does the underlined word humiliation in Paragraph mean A Carrying out an important plan B Being made to feel ashamed C Trying hard to survive an accident D Feeling hopeless in an emergency The sex differences between people bullied for the first time during adolescence are reflected in A the support they get from the society B the effect bullying has on them C the way they react to provocation D the type of bullying they receive Take the opportunity to travel when studying abroad If

Mr Johnson took the only escape route through the boot Mr Johnson s car had finished up in a ditch at Romney Marsin Kent after skidding on ice and hitting a bank Fortunately the water began to come in only slowly Mr Johnson said I couldn t force the doors because they were jammed against the walls of the ditch and dared not open the windows because I knew water would come flooding in Mr Johnson a sweet salesman of Sitting Home Kent first tried to attract the attention of other motorists by sounding the horn and hammering on the roof and boot Then he began his struggle to escape Later he said It was really a half penny that saved my life It was the only coin I had in my pocket and I used it to unscrew the back seat to get into the boot I hammered desperately with a hammer trying to make someone hear but no help came It took ten minutes to unscrew the seat and a further five minutes to clear the sweet samples from the boot Then Mr Johnson found a wrench and began to work on the boot lock Fifteen minutes passed by It was the only chance I had Finally it gave but as soon as I moved the boot lid the water and mud poured in I forced the lid down into the mud and scrambled clear as the car filled up His hands and arms cut and bruised Mr Johnson got to Beckett Farm nearby where he was looked after by the farmer s wife Mrs Lucy Bates Huddled in a blanket he said That thirty minutes seemed like hours Only the tips of the car wheels were visible police said last night The vehicle had sunk into two feet of mud at the bottom of the ditch What is the best title for this

friend and I were in the shop that she owns It was the middle of the afternoon we were both pretty happy and making plans for the weekend and the atmosphere was extremely relaxed almost lazy Suddenly a man entered the shop We knew somehow that he didn t look like one of our usual customers but we welcomed him politely anyway Without any hesitation he pulled something out of his coat that we did not recognize immediately but when he ordered us to go into the back with him there was no doubt that this something was a gun Giving us precise orders he offended us and kept reminding us that he could shoot at any time He looked for the money in the register from our wallets and then he asked for our jewelry and we gave him all he wanted Finally he brought his job to conclusion and left When I was a child I felt safe with my parents in my home or wherever I was not alone Then I began to understand the news and I learnt that horrible things were happening out there but I still kept thinking that those events were just other people s worries not mine From the precise moment the guy walked out of the shop I completely changed my way of relating to the world I always look around to see which kinds of people are possibly following me Now I usually double check everything If I ve locked myself in the car or in the house I am always careful not to wear any jewelry Whenever an unknown guy is getting too close or is trying to get information from me I tighten up I know that it is wrong that not everyone is looking to attack me again After all I consider myself lucky since nothing really bad happened to me or to my friend but what affects me is the thought of what could have happened We could have died or he could have beaten or raped us I know that I have to work on it because since that day I haven t felt safe anymore What I don t know is where to start Now I am sure only of one fact that I blame this guy not for having taken my jewelry but for having deprived me of my innocence Which of the following statements best describes the main idea of the passage A A joke that a stupid friend played on the writer B Terrible things can happen to anybody C A car accident and other bad things that happen to people D A robbery and its effect on the writer s life Which is true according to the passage A The man in the shop was one of the usual customers B The robber took money and jewelry C The writer knew immediately that the robber had a gun D The writer was in the shop alone when the robber entered How is it that the author considers herself lucky A She did not lose all her money B She has never been robbed again C She has only injured slightly D She could have been hurt or killed but she wasn t What was the most serious result of the robbery to the writer A She doesn t trust others or feel safe B She and her friend were beaten and raped C Her friend closed the store after the robbery D The robber was still at large D Many Americans are turning to Japan they think a country of high academic achievement and economic success for possible answers However the answers provided by Japanese preschools are not the ones Americans expected to find In most Japanese preschools surprisingly little emphasis is put on academic instruction In one survey Japanese and American preschool teachers child development specialists and parents were asked about various aspects of early childhood education Only percent of the Japanese respondents listed to give children a good start academically as one of their top three reasons for a society to have preschools In contrast over half the American respondents chose this as one of their top three choices To prepare children for successful careers in first grade and beyond Japanese schools do not teach reading writing and mathematics but rather skills such as determination concentration and the ability to work as a member of a group The huge majority of young Japanese children are taught to read at home by their parents Like in America there is diversity in Japanese early childhood education Some Japanese kindergartens have specific aims such as early musical training or potential development In large cities some kindergartens are attached to universities that have elementary and secondary schools Some Japanese parents believe that if their young children attend a university based program it will increase the children s chances of eventually being admitted to top rated schools and universities Several more progressive programs have introduced free play as a way out for the heavy intellectualizing in some Japanese kindergartens We learn from the first paragraph that many Americans believe A Japanese parents are more involved in preschool education than American parents B Japan s economic success is a result of its scientific achievements C Japanese preschool education emphasizes academic instruction D Japan s higher education is superior to theirs In Japan s preschool education the focus is on A preparing children academically B developing children s artistic interests C teaching children mathematics D shaping children s character Why do some Japanese parents send their children to university based kindergartens A They can do better in their future studies B They can make more group experience grow there C They can be individually oriented when they grow up D They can have better chances of getting a first rate education Free play has been introduced in some Japanese kindergartens in order to A broaden children s knowledge B train children s creativity C lighten children s study load D enrich children s experience As you grow rapidly through your teenage years you will experience a lot of changes The changes may seem difficult Don t panic You will deal successfully with them You are a young adult now With more responsibility you will find more freedom to make your own choices This is a time to be well informed about making choices In this way you can make healthy balanced decisions You may already know your career path or you may have no idea at all what you want to do Both situations are fine Work hard and the right opportunity will present itself to you Young adulthood means greater freedom and more choices But try not to shut your family out of your life You should learn to think of others even though you are old enough to look after yourself It is also perfectly natural at this time for you to spend more time with your friends than your family A true friend will stand by you no matter what happens This period is part of the life cycle There are some people who will be with you throughout life s journey and there will be some people with whom you part and go separate ways Leaving school can be hard The reality is that you may not even see all of your classmates again You are a young adult It is your life No one can live it for you So making the right choices will be important to you Life is for living Enjoy your life wisely Choose your friends wisely They will help shape the future They may seem to happen quickly You will probably want to be independent You may appreciate what you have in your own life

planets for the better E books for anyone who is unfamiliar with the term are about the same size and shape as regular books They have a large screen in the middle however this screen shows the reader a page of the text that has been downloaded from a computer Once the reader has finished reading the page on the e book screen he or she scrolls down to see a new page The process continues until the entire book has been read As you pointed out Mr Slocum it s great to lie on a warm sandy beach with a book You can do that just as easily with an e book as you can with a traditional paper book In fact because e books are so light you can carry themselves Say for example that you like to read on the bus Which would you rather carry with you a heavy page novel or an e book that weighs only a few ounces Another important advantage is offered by e books as well They are more environment friendly than traditional books At present thousands of trees arecut down each year to meet the publishing industry s demand for paper Books that don t sell are eventually returned to the publisher and destroyed This terrible waste could be avoided if everyone used e books which require no paper Sincerely David Eng What does Editor Henry Slocum think about e books A Interesting B Expensive C Convenient D Environment friendly What is mainly talked about in Paragraph A What an e book is B Why e books are popular C How e books have developed D Who are the readers of e books In David s letter he thinks that A E books will come down in price B E books come in various sizes and shapes C E books do little harm to the environment D E books are no better than traditional books The main purpose of the letter is to A explain how to read e books B honor the person who invented e books C scold publishers for wasting so much paper D provide evidence that e books are a good idea B Monitoring the mood of a pet dog could be used as an early warning sign that an elderly owner is struggling to cope a new report has claimed Researchers placed movement sensors on dogs to track their behavior and identified distinct activities including chewing barking sitting and digging This allowed them to map the normal behavior of a healthy happy dog which means any changes can be monitored and could indicate an issue with their owner Nils Hammerla part of the team from Newcastle University said Humans and dogs have lived together in close relationships for thousands of years which has led to strong emotional and social mutual bonds A dog s physical and emotional dependence on their owner means that their well being is likely to reflect that of their owner Any changes such as the dog being walked less often perhaps not being fed regularly or simply demonstrating unhappy behavior could be an early indicator for families that an older relative needs help This is the first system of its kind which allows us to remotely monitor a dog s behavior in its natural setting The team of academics who presented their findings at the UbiComp conference in Zurich created a hi tech waterproof dog collar for the study Dr Cas Ladha who led the study said A lot of our research is focused on developing intelligent systems that can help older people to live independently for longer But developing a system that reassures family and carers that an older relative is well without intruding on the individual s privacy is difficult This is just the first step but the idea behind this research is that it would allow us to support people without the need for cameras A range of dogs was used for the study as the team needed to map distinct behaviors that correlated between different breeds From the text we know that Nils Hammerla A led the study and identified activities of dogs B thinks some activities of dogs can reflect senior owners health C studied the relationship between humans and animals D developed a hi tech waterproof dog collar The underlined word reassure in Paragraph probably means A keep one s word B remove one s doubt C take one s advice D lose one s face Which of the following is an advantage of the intelligent system mentioned in the text A It can indicate that people aren t well B It can identify different activities of dogs C It monitors an elderly owner without disturbing his privacy D It lets people see the dog s behavior clearly Which of the following could be the best title for the text A Dogs mood can be an indicator of owners health B Strong bonds between dogs and their senior owners C Signs that your older relative needs help D A special way of taking care of the old C Dear David I m glad you would like to share your feelings with me It s hardly surprising that your feelings of not being grown up have come on strongly at this point in your life just before you re about to become a father You are asking Will I make a good father How will I cope I think nearly every man must have the occasional feelings of self doubt and inadequacy before the birth It s difficult honestly to feel grown up unless you have something less grown up to relate to The boss with a hen pecking wife may feel like a seven year old when he s at home But as he walks through the office door and knows he s going to be surrounded by staff for advice he grows into a fully mature man And I think it s a mistake to imagine that we all feel as we age a kind of progress of states from the baby to the adult Most people feel on Tuesday about three years old and on a Wednesday around There s a common remark that all men are little boys but it s not true It s more true that men often behave like little boys But nearly all people at some moments in their lives are able to be greatly mature Once your baby arrives you ll soon feel less childlike When your child tries to put its fingers into the electric plug the adult in you will rise up to prevent it Comfort yourself David with two truths One is that your friends laugh when they talk about this subject because they like you feel frightened And remember that people who haven t grown up don t go around talking about the fact Good luck to you and your little one Sincerely Yours Miss Advice According to the passage Miss Advice thinks David s self doubt A valuable B unusual C natural D bearable From Paragraph we can learn that people s sense of maturity A will increase with age B is obviously seen at home C changes with different situations D becomes stronger with familiar people Miss Advice holds that A all men behave like little boys B people tend to laugh at the subject C men with a baby feel more grown up D people enjoy talking about their immaturity D Silence is unnatural to man He begins life with a cry and ends it in stillness In between he does all he can to make a noise in the world and he fears silence more than anything else Even his conversation is an attempt to prevent a fearful silence If he is introduced to another person and a number of pauses occur in the conversation he regards himself as a failure a worthless person and is full of envy of the emptiest headed chatterbox He knows that ninety nine percent of human conversation means no more than the buzzing of a fly but he is anxious to join in the buzz and to prove that he is a man and not a waxwork figure The aim of conversation is not for the most part to communicate ideas it is to keep up the buzzing sound There are it must be admitted different qualities of buzz there is even a buzz that is as annoying as the continuous noise made by a mosquito But at a dinner party one would rather be a mosquito than a quiet person Most buzzing fortunately is pleasant to the ear and some of it is pleasant even to the mind He would be a foolish man if he waited until he had a wise thought to take part in the buzzing with his neighbors Those who hate to pick up the weather as a conversational opening seem to me not to know the reason why human beings wish to talk Very few human beings join in a conversation in the hope of learning anything new Some of them are content if they are merely allowed to go on making a noise into other people s ears though they have nothing to tell them except that they have seen two or three new plays or that they had food in a Swiss hotel At the end of an evening during which they have said nothing meaningful for a long time they just prove themselves to be successful conservationists According to the author people make conversation to A exchange ideas B prove their value C achieve success in life D overcome their fear of silence By the buzzing of a fly Para the author means A the noise of an insect B a low whispering sound C meaningless talks D the voice of a chatterbox According to the passage people usually talk to their neighbors A about whatever they have prepared B about whatever they want to C in the hope of learning something new D in the hope of getting on well What is the author s purpose in writing the passage A To discuss why people like talking about weather B To encourage people to join in conversations C To persuade people to stop making noises D To explain why people keep talking Urbanization Until relatively recently the vast majority of human beings lived and died without ever seeing a city The first city was probably founded no more than years ago In fact nearly everyone lived on farms or in tiny rural villages It was not until the th century that Great Britain became the first urban society in history a society in which the majority of people live in cities and do not farm for a living Britain was only the beginning The process of urbanization the migration of people from the countryside to the city was the result of modernization which has rapidly transformed how people live and where they live In fewer than of Americans lived in urban areas Today over of Americans live in cities Only about live on farms Large cities were impossible until agriculture became industrialized Even in advanced agricultural societies it took about ninety five people on farms to feed five people in cities Until modern times those living in cities were mainly the ruling elite and the servants laborers and professionals who served them Cities survived by taxing farmers and were limited in size by the amount of surplus food that the rural population produced and by the ability to move this surplus from farm to city Over the past two centuries the Industrial Revolution has broken this balance between the city and the country Today instead of needing ninety five farmers to feed five city people one American farmer is able to feed more than a hundred non farmers A That kept cities very small B The rest live in small towns C The effects of urban living on people should be considered D Soon many other industrial nations become urban societies E But even years ago only a few people could live in cities F Modernization drew people to the cities and made farmers more productive G Modern cities

into friendship shows that our social circle peaks at years and seven months at which we typically have five close friends Women are most popular at years and months with men hitting the friendship highest point a little later at years and three months The research by Forever Friends shows that a third of adults meet their closest friends while at school with a fifth saying they meet them at work Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter now also play a major role in building new friendships The research points out that to year olds make friends via Facebook compared to to year olds who make and to year olds who make just four Forever Friends relationship coach Sam Owen says It is no coincidence that over a third of us meet our best friends at school It is a key time in our lives when friendships are growing through sharing notes giving gifts seeing each other regularly and laughing a lot As adults we can often forget how powerful these small things are and how the little things can make a difference Later in life we find ourselves losing friends Over half of us lose friendships through moving while say that over time they grow apart from close pals Having children

poppy on her coat collar and carried a bouquet of smaller poppies World War I was going on overseas and Moina was determined to do her part Moina was a teacher at University of Georgia when the war broke out She planned to do more than making socks or sweaters for the Red Cross She wanted to encourage the soldiers before they left for war Moina traveled to New York to care for soldiers at the medical center at Columbia University There was nothing she enjoyed more than sitting and chatting with the soldiers She looked at the photos of their families and brought fresh flowers to brighten the rooms when the weather outside turned grey Earlier that November morning she found a well known poem in a magazine which began In Flanders fields the pop pies blow between the crosses row on row Moina had read the poem before She knew that John a Canadian physician wrote it while treating soldiers on the battlefields of Flanders in Belgium The poem remembering the dead always touched her But that morning Moina was struck by the last verse and pictures Soldiers with sad eyes stared at a battleground full of white crosses and bright red poppies Remember us the soldiers seemed to be speaking to her Moina thought about the soldiers at the medical center how they had left their families and homes to protect the freedom she enjoyed each day To Moina they were heroes Silently she made a promise She would always wear a red poppy to remember the soldiers Which of the following can best replace the underlined phrase do her part in Paragraph l A join the army B become a doctor C make her own efforts D be a Red Cross member Where did Moina make her promise A In Canada B In Belgium C At Columbia University D At University of Georgia Moina considered the red poppy as A the logo of the medical center B the city flower of New York C a memorial flower for soldiers D a symbol of University of Georgia John wrote the poem A in hope of a bright future B in memory of the dead soldiers C to treat the soldiers on the battlefields D to show Moina s love for the soldiers C From sleeping standing up to shutting down half of their brain animals have some strange sleeping habits Now some of these unusual habits from napping giraffes to birds that sleep while flying have been shown in a chart This chart shows that little brown bats are very lethargic sleeping for around hours per day This long period of sleep is thought to be a way of conserving energy and it means brown bats only hunt for a few hours each night when their insect food is available In contrast giraffes can go weeks without sleep because these large and slow moving animals are constantly easy to the attacks from predators However other animals are experts at multitasking and can swim or fly while sleeping For example dolphins and whales sleep while keeping half of their brain alert so they don t drown with dolphins typically napping for around hours a day The method is known as logging and it has been observed in bottlenose dolphins which keep half of their brain at a low level of alertness This allows the dolphin to keep enough consciousness to carry on breathing through its blowhole While sea otters aren t alert while they sleep they form rafts so they are not separated from each other The creatures sometimes hold hands or paws when they sleep and typically eat sleep and rest while floating in groups of rafts The underlined word lethargic in Paragraph is closest in meaning to A sleepy B inactive C energetic D movable Why do little brown bats have a long period of sleep A To avoid sunshine B To save more energy C To relax themselves D To wait for their insect food How do dolphins avoid drowning while sleeping A By taking extra naps B By holding hands or paws C By keeping half of their brain alert D By breathing through their blowholes What do sea otters do in order not to be separated from each other A They don t sleep B They float on rafts C They float in groups D They hold hands all the time D My wife and I recently driving through Arizona stopped at a collector s shop in Tucson where stones and minerals of many kinds were on display During the visit we were taken into a small room where ordinary looking rocks were laid out on shelves Had I seen them on some hillside I would not have given them a second thought Then the man closed the door so that the room was in total darkness and turned on an ultraviolet lamp Instantly the rocks leaped into a kind of glory Brilliant colors of an indescribable beauty were there before our eyes a certain power had been switched on and a hidden world leaped into life As I look at my universe and walk among my fellow humans I have the deep belief that hidden realities are all around us there in the physical world and there also in the human world I believe then that my chief job in life is to switch on an extra power so that I can see what my naked eyes or my naked mind cannot now see I believe that I have to do this particularly with my human fellows My ordinary eyes tend to stop short at those envelopes we call human bodies But we have learned that by turning on a certain power we can see through to the inside of these envelopes We call this extra power imagination At its highest we call it empathy the power to see through and to feel through to the inner life of other human beings When we turn on this lamp of imaginative sensitivity we make the ordinary human beings around us come excitingly alive When we are aware that there are glories of life still hidden from us we walk humbly before the Great Unknown But we do more than this we try to increase our powers of seeing and feeling so that we can turn what is still unknown into what is warmly and understandingly known This I believe is our great human adventure Why does the writer mention their visit to the collector s shop A To introduce the topic B To share his experience C To explain his point D To provide evidence Which of the following does the writer agree with A Hidden realities remain in the physical world B Ordinary minds can never reach others inside C He had seen the very rocks on some hillside before D We should stay humble when we are still unknown It can be referred to as a great human adventure that A we walk humbly before the Great Unknown B our eyes stop short at ordinary human beings C we try hard to discover the hidden glories of life D we are aware of the truth of hidden realities S Nowadays there is a trend that more and more people spend their holidays Jn foreign countries So read our travel

behaviors in class It took him years to express regret In a letter publish in a magazine Mr Gove says It may be too late to say I m sorry But as my mom told me it s never too late to set the record straight Researchers argue that people have too high expectations of the power of saying sorry Some psychologists said in a study that receive an apology isn t as help as people think Nevertheless apologies might be an important social tool as they reaffirm the exist of rules that need to be observed The Education Secretary s apology might have been accepted by his old teacher but he might get he into trouble According to the Daily Mail Mr Gove s mother didn t know her son was causing trouble at school and she say He would have been punished I had known he was being so naughty Later Gove

radiation a form of energy that has been shown to damage DMA and cause cancer Although the amount of radiation is extremely low equal to the radiation a person would receive in a few minutes of flying several research studies have concluded that a small number of cancer cases would result from scanning hundreds of millions of passengers a year European countries will be allowed to use an alternative body scanner relying on radio frequency waves which have not been linked to cancer The U S Transportation Security Administration TSA has also used hundreds of those machines known as millimeter wave scanners in U S airports But unlike Europe it has decided to use both types of scanners The TSA would not comment specifically on the EU s decision But in a statement TSA spokesman Mike McCarthy said As one of our many layers of security TSA uses the most advanced technology available to provide the best opportunity to detect dangerous items such as explosives We strictly test our technology to ensure it meets our high detection and safety standards before it is placed in airports he continued Since January advanced imaging technology has detected more than dangerous or illegal items on passengers in U S airports nationwide Body scanners have been controversial in the United States since they were first used in prisons in the late s and then in airports for tests after Why did the European prohibit the use of X ray scanners in European airports A Because they are made in the USA B Because they are not effective in use C Because they might do harm to passengers D Because their radiation is extremely low Which of the following is true about the new body scanners to be used in Europe A They will risk doing harm to passengers B They use ionizing radiation heavily C Their radiation is extremely high D They won t risk causing cancer What can we infer from TSA s statement A The TSA will stop using the X ray scanners B The TSA won t use EU s alternative scanners C The EU s alternative scanners are not advanced D The X ray scanners are safe and effective What is the main idea of the passage A EU and the US have a different opinion B Europe Bans X Ray Body Scanners Used at US Airports C Different scanners will be used in American D Body scanners have been controversial D If drinking coffee or tea has become part of your daily routine you might wonder what it s doing to your long term heart health New research from Arteriosclerosis Thrombosis and Vascular Biology a journal of the American Heart Association found that high tea consumption and proper coffee consumption may be associated with decreased rates of death from coronary heart disease CHD The study followed more than tea and coffee drinkers over years Participants completed food recalls to document their typical intake of tea and coffee and were divided into groups that ranged from light to heavy consumption Researchers accounted for variables such as health histories height weight and waist circumference and recorded the number of deaths from cardiovascular disease and stroke during the study period Overall results showed that consuming more than six cups of tea per day was associated with a lower risk of death from heart disease compared to consuming less than one cup of tea per day There appeared to be no such protective effect of tea drinking at any amount for risk of death from stroke Among coffee drinkers more proper consumption levels cups per day were associated with the greatest risk reduction for death from heart disease compared to drinking less than one cup of coffee per day Researchers acknowledged certain inconclusive variables within their findings For example the difference between decaffeinated and regular coffee could not be accurately accounted for nor could specific recommendations be made for type of tea though due to its popularity in the Netherlands where the study took place researchers assumed most tea consumption to be black tea Furthermore researchers found that tea and coffee drinkers had opposite lifestyles with tea drinkers tending to engage in healthy lifestyle habits and coffee drinkers being more likely to eat less healthy and smoke It was difficult to say with certainty what impact these other lifestyle variables may have contributed to the overall results What s the conclusion of the study A People should drink tea and coffee as much as possible B Drinking more tea may benefit people with CHD C High tea consumption may reduce the rate of stroke D Coffee consumption has nothing to do with heart disease Which of the following variables haven t been considered A Health histories B Height and weight C Waist circumference D The type of tea and coffee What can be inferred from the last paragraph A All people in the Netherlands like black tea B Tea and coffee drinkers had a similar life style C Other variables have no effect on the results D There are still something uncertain about the study Which

biology history etc This can help you identify your strengths and interests so you can narrow your list of possible university degree programs to a particular field of study Prioritize your career wants and needs First and foremost a college major should be chosen based on your interest and career goals However it is not uncommon for students to select their majors based on the careers of their

aspects of a career are most important to you money creative freedom helping people working outdoors etc Making a list of your top priorities will shed plenty of light on which degree or major is best

northern India s Assam Not long after that he decided to dedicate his life to this effort so he moved to the site in order that he could work full time creating a new forest ecosystem Unbelievably the spot today hosts a sprawling acres of jungle that Payeng single handedly planted The times of India recently caught up with Payeng in his remote forest cottage to learn more about how he came to leave such an unbelievable mark on the landscape It all started way back in when floods washed a large number of snakes ashore on the sandbar One day after the floods Payeng only then found the place dotted with the dead snakes That was the turning point of his life The snakes died in the heat without any tree cover I sat down and wept over their lifeless bodies I asked the forest department if they could grow trees there They said nothing would grow there Instead they asked me to try growing bamboo It was painful but I did it There was nobody to help me Nobody was interested says Payeng now While it s taken years for Payeng s remarkable dedication to planting to receive some well deserved recognition internationally it didn t take long for wildlife in the region to benefit from the forest Demonstrating a keen understanding of ecological balance Payeng even transplanted ants to his ecosystem to maintain its natural harmony Soon the shadeless sandbar was transformed into a natural ecosystem The forest called the Molai woods now serves as a safe habitat for numerous birds deer tigers and eleghants Despite Payeng s outstanding project forestry officials in the region first learned of this new forest in and since then they ve come to recognize his efforts as truly remarkable but perhaps not enough We re amazed at Payeng says Gunin Sailia Assistant Conservator of Forests He has been at it for years Had he been in any other country he would have been made a hero Payeng moved to the barren sandbar to A make a living there B plant trees to improve the environment C do some research D look after the acres jungle It can be concluded that the interview in the report above was conducted in A B C D Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage A Payeng got a lot of help from the forest department at the beginning B It took quite a long time for Payeng s dedication to be recognized C Payeng earned his fame by transplanting ants to his ecosystem D The Molai woods now is used as a zoo to attract India tourists The underlined sentence implies that A Payeng should be honored as a great hero in India B Payeng has been a great hero in other countries C other countries should not make Payeng a hero D India made Payeng a hero earlier than other countries C One retired high school teacher in Canada has a great surprise for his former students that is years in the making In Bruce Farrer s ninth grade English class at Bert Fox Community High School in Saskatchewan got a special assignment reported the National Post Farrer asked his students to write a page letter to their future selves which he then promised to mail to them years later Farrer kept his promise to those students as well as other students he taught during his more than year career I was trying to think of some assignments that would be special and it just sort of came up Well I would try this assignment Farrer said on CBC Morning Edition Although Farrer retired in he took several boxes of the letters from his former students with him and began the long and difficult process of tracking them down and mailing the letters One former student Scott Fulton became a teacher himself and even taught for a while at the high school he went to as a teenager according to CBC News He got his letter last week I was just feeling honored and grateful Fulton said after receiving the handwritten letter Another former student DJ Anardi got the letter from his past self about a month ago It read Hey you good looking guy how is your life according to the National Post Anardi s letter said that he had a crush on the woman at the time who is now his wife I think our society now is a society of non commitment Farrer said We say we re going to do something whether it s in a marriage or with our kids or maybe even with our organizations we join I think it s important to have a sense of commitment and maybe in a minor way the kids see I value that Farrer promised his students that he would A grade the assignments carefully B write back to them sooner or later C send their letters back in the future D keep in touch with them all the time According to CBC News Scott Fulton A did well in his lessons at school B often wrote to other classmates C was very happy to work with Farrer D used to be a teacher in his mother school The underlined phrase had a crush on in Paragraph probably means A fell in love with B took the place of C caught up with D broke away from If you make a commitment you should A help others often B keep your promise C join an organization D make your kids satisfied D As I enter my s I ve noticed many of my parents generation think social networking is something they are simply incapable of understanding They fear that should they try they would somehow get it wrong they would say the wrong thing do the wrong thing or behave in a way that causes embarrassment But here s the first secret of social media Everyone feels this way I recently met a young actress who complained that her work demands that she join microblog but she always feels like she doesn t have anything smart to say It s the same resistance I hear from the older generation who however have somehow convinced themselves that age is the barrier rather than the differences of individual taste Here s the second secret of social media everybody uses it for more or less the same reasons The older generation often sign up to stay in touch with children and relatives We consider this kind of contact as an old fashioned activity but it is exactly why younger people use social media The truth is most people use social media to gently keep an eye on one another to see how those they care about are doing without needing to ring them up on the phone every night And this is the last secret of social media everyone gets to use it their own way Newcomers the younger and the older who worry about getting it right are assuming that there s a right way to get it But actually there isn t Personally I talk a lot on microblog And some people post nothing and they use social media every day as readers Social media companies would rather see people filling their networks up with pictures and posts but there s no rule against being a fly on the wall It s also a fine way to engage We re quick to forget that the web wasn t invented by year olds it was created by today s seniors I d never try forcing those with no interest on social networks to use microblog But don t let the talk of age divides put you off There s nothing to stop the older generation from retaking the network their own generation created What s the author s purpose of writing this passage A To share with us his personal experience of using social media B To tell us a few secrets of social media that he discovered C To explain why the old generation don t use social media D To relieve the old generation from fearing using social media The underlined words a fly on the wall in the th paragraph refer to A a person who promotes reading online books B a person who only watches others posts quietly C a person who causes trouble to others D a person who posts many pictures According to the author which is a reason for old people s fear of using social media A They believe that they may fall into embarrassing situations B They prefer to stay in touch with relatives in real life C They have no interest in social networking D They have no idea what to post online Which of the following may best describe the structure of the passage A B C D E AB F AC G AD I would love to be happier as I m sure most people would so I thought it would be interesting to find some ways to become a happier person Exercise more Exercise has such a deep effect on our happiness and well being that it s actually been proven to be an effective strategy for overcoming depression It can also improve your figure even if you don t lose any weight Sleep more We know that

opportunities to help others were taken away A Social time is highly valuable when it comes to improving our happiness B People who exercise feel better about their bodies C It can help you to relax

teens may overlook With TV movies computers and video games become more and more popular it has become so much easy for teens to be by themselves rather than going out with friends Kids used to hang out at the mall or drive around the town now they just sit at home Getting teens into a sport gives them opportunity to go out and socialize they may not find a new best friend they will learn how to interact and work as a team something they they ll find use later in life More and more kids are becoming overweight If teens see that their physical condition is causing them to perform bad they may

people buy books and products from Amazon an online seller They order and pay over the Internet and the books are shipped through the mail or a delivery service like FedEx One day people could get their Amazon deliveries from an unmanned aerial vehicle a tiny flying vehicle that looks like a toy helicopter And instead of waiting days to get the parcel it could be at the buyer s home in half an hour or less The company is working on a fleet of tiny vehicles they call Prime Air The vehicles are also known as octocopters On their website Amazon says one day Prime Air vehicles will be as normal as seeing mail trucks on the road today The U S s Federal Aviation Administration FAA is working on safety regulations for unmanned flying vehicles like the Prime Air copters Those regulations will make sure the copters are able to fly safely where they need to go Once the FAA has put its rules in place which could be as early as Amazon will be ready with its fleet of tiny flyers The process could take as many as five years The new delivery service would likely be available only in the United States at first The copters the company is testing now can handle packages up to five pounds kg and they have a range of miles kilometres Other companies are also looking at using unmanned flying vehicles to deliver their products For instance Domino s Pizza in the UK released a video showing a DomiCopter delivering a pizza That video may have been a publicity stunt In any case just like Prime Air s octocopters the DomiCopters don t have clearance to take off just yet For what purpose does Amazon want to use the Prime Air A To remind people to order online B To check the delivery service C To shorten the delivery period D To predict the sales volumes What does Paragraph Four mainly tell

great progress B The new vehicles would be put into immediate production C The designer will promote his new product to other countries D The similar delivery vehicles in other places worked out to be well B When Luke went to university he thought he would be starting a new journey in life and getting his own place In the UK it s common to fly the nest at a fairly young age Many choose a flatshare others make plans to get on the property ladder But the current economic situation forced Luke back to his mum s house at the age of And he s not alone a quarter of young adults in the UK now live with their parents The Office for National Statistics said more than million adults between the ages of and were living with their parents in Lack of jobs and the high cost of renting accommodation made Luke change his plans He s frustrated There s something very difficult about being an adult living in an environment where you re still a child he says It limits me socially sometimes I feel it limits me professionally Indeed many young people have no choice but to stay at the hotel of Mum and Dad Krissy had to return home after a year away and now lives in rather cramped conditions sharing the family s three bedroom house with her siblings She says they end up getting on each other s nerves when it s time to use the bathroom in the morning Of course residing with your parents is not unusual in some countries Economic conditions culture or family traditions mean many young people stay at home until they get married Even then it can be too expensive to rent or buy a house and the married couple continue to live at one of their parents homes But some parents seem to enjoy having their kids back at home Janice s daughters are part of what s being called the boomerang generation She says I get to share their lives with them and I ve got to know them all as adults We have the sort of conversations that good friends do So for some it s a win win situation spending time with your families and saving money How is the passage developed A By listing figures B By offering examples C By analyzing causes D By making comparisons We can learn from the passage that A All the parents enjoy living with their children B Living with parents is common in some countries C The author approves of children s living with parents D Janice belongs to a group called the boomerang generation What does the underlined sentence mean in the fifth paragraph A They shout at each other angrily B They get on very well with each other C They finally make each other annoyed D They are unwilling to sharing with each other What is the purpose of the passage A To persuade children into living on their own after getting married B To show the present situation of young people living with their parents C To compare the advantages and disadvantages of living with parents D To solve the problems young adults may face after going to university C Don t we all know a Happy Meal when we see one the famous boxed meal that includes a hamburger a kid sized portion of fries a drink and so on served with a toy that s extremely popular with children who love to collect them But collectors of these little toys will soon be in for a surprise For the book lovers though there is some good news McDonalds will replace toys with books However each of these books will mainly pass on nutritional messages Do you know that McDonalds has been marketing the boxed kid s meal since Happy Meals are extremely popular with kids especially for its collectible toys when you consider that over billion of these packages are sold each year These packages have been very controversial Health supporters believe that drawing kids to these meals with toys is a clever way of promoting unhealthy food choices They see it as an advertising strategy of catching its customers young a move that has paid off very well for the fast food company Child development experts say that food habits get formed in children by age six and continue through to their adult life Fatty and sugary foods such as those served in McDonalds Happy Meals are believed to play a big role in growing health problems such as obesity and diabetes Public health care costs have gone up and untold amounts of other health problems In the State of California tried to ban toys in Happy Meals But it was strongly opposed by some as being heavy handed and the ban was thrown out by the government While some people believe that McDonalds with its large following of children can create a powerful message through the books others believe its actions are contradictory Anyway the company is trying to spread the message of nutrition while it is serving food that is anything but healthy What s the aim of the question raised in the first paragraph A To give a surprise to the book lovers B To persuade the readers to buy boxed meals C To make the readers think about the answer D To get the readers attention to the passage Books will be added into Happy Meals to A encourage more kids to read books B introduce the history of McDonald s C have kids learn more about nutrition D help young kids learn to read and write In the author s opinion Happy Meals A bring much fun to children B do no actual good to children s health C are popular with the young and the old D teach children a lot about nutrition Which of the following can be the best title for the passage A Are Happy Meals Really Happy B The links Between Food and Health C The Importance of Eating Healthy Food D Happy Meal A New Advertising Method D Parents who exert too much control over their children could be causing them lifelong psychological damage according to a study which tracked a group of people born in the s until the present day Researchers found that people who reported that parents had intruded on their privacy in childhood or encouraged dependence were more likely to have low scores in surveys of happiness and general wellbeing carried out in their teens their s their s and even their s The negative impact on wellbeing was comparable in degree to that observed in people who have lost a family member experts from University College London UCL said In contrast people who said their parents were more caring warm and responsive to their needs tended to be more content well into adulthood The findings are the culmination of a survey which has tracked more than people since their birth in It is well established that childhood influences can have profound effect on the developing brain but this is one of the first studies that have attempted to measure their impact over such a long period of time Information on parenting styles was only available from the study participants themselves who were asked to recall their childhoods when in their s and may therefore suffer from a degree of so called recall bias unhappy people may be more likely to depict their parents as controlling However the research said the findings agreed with previous studies which have shown that children who are able to form secure emotional bonds with parents are more likely to have secure happy relationships later in life parents also give us stable base from which to explore the world while warmth and responsiveness has been shown to promote social and emotional development said Dr Maid Stafford of the Medical Research Council s MRC Lifelong and Ageing unit at UCL By contrast psychological control can limit a child s independence and leave them less able to regulate their own behaviour Dr Stafford said that the study did not seek to blame parents Parents are vitally important to the mental wellbeing of future generations she said Policies to reduce economic and other pressures on parents could help them to foster better relationships with their children Previous research has shown a clear link between economic stress in parents and poorer early child development What can be inferred from the passage A Various parenting styles can count B An unfair finding can easily mislead parents C There is a side effect from too much control over children D There is a link between parents economy and child development According to the passage which of the following statements is TRUE A Children should say no to parents control B Physical control can limit a child s independence C Parents control over children is completely wrong D People of many age ranges are interviewed in the survey The study according to Dr Stafford is intended to A blame parents with control over children B encourage the children s dependence C point out the necessity of parenting D build up proper parenting styles The underlined word culmination in Paragraph Five probably means A result B effect C prediction D warning Why Do Autumn Leaves Change Color We all enjoy the colors of autumn leaves To answer this questions we first have to understand what leaves are and what they do Leaves are nature s food factories Plants take water from the ground through their roots and take carbon dioxide from the air Plants use the sugar as food for energy and as a building block for growing The way plants turn water and carbon dioxide into sugar is called photosynthesis Chlorophyll helps make photosynthesis happen Chlorophyll is what gives plants their green color As summer ends and autumn comes the days get shorter and shorter During winter there is not enough light or water for photosynthesis The trees will rest and begin to shut down their food making factories The green chlorophyll disappears from the leaves As the bright green fades away we begin to see yellow and orange colors We just can t see them in the summer because they are covered up by the green chlorophyll The bright reds and purples we see in leaves are made mostly in Autumn In some trees like maples glucose is trapped in the leaves after photosynthesis stops The brown color of trees like oaks is made from wastes left in the leaves All these things make the beautiful colors we enjoy in Autumn A Yellow and orange colors attract many of us in Autumn B This is how the trees know to begin getting ready for winter C Have you ever wondered how and why a fall leaf changes color D Small amounts of these colors have been in the leaves all along E For what reason do people prefer autumn leaves to summer leaves F Sunlight and the cool nights of autumn make the leaves a red color G Plants use sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide into a kind of sugar A B C D Remembering My Father s Vest People get into trouble because they don t know enough to keep cool As a child I had a lot of that had been held back and not released Worse still I was not good at constructively Once as I was getting ready for school my mother

by violently tearing it apart from my chest Later my mother shared her own with my father See what your son has done Instead of scolding or abusing me my father responded by asking my mother to the vest He then worn it to work the next day When my mother told me about my father s response much later when I had from my fit I immediately felt a great sense of for my violent behavior just that he was spending the entire day wearing a n vest At the same time I was filled with great for my father whose gentle kindness taught me a life lesson I would treasure forever On that day I made a never to

chopsticks to see if their food had been poisoned W OK thank you And I d like to know why Chinese people use chopsticks Why not knives and forks like Americans M Oh that is a good question I think

Gregorio a town that you can easily I know because I drove right through it and up on a narrow pine tree bordered asphalt road that felt like it would go on A few people just moved around outside the San Gregorio General Store talking about the motorcycles they ve owned over the years Inside I found a bar with regular customers two people playing guitar together and of course a full on store I a song took a seat quickly and watched the guitarists play and dance Then I congratulated them a couple of wrinkled dollars in their bucket and walked back out into the world It was pouring outside We

A B C D A A classic joke goes like this A nurse rushes into an exam room and says Doctor doctor there s an invisible man in the waiting room The doctor says Tell him I can t see him Pretty simple right Here s how I tell it A nurse her name is Joyce feels a presence in the waiting room She looks around but sees nothing She jumps up from her desk carefully replaces her chair and runs down the lavender hued hallway to the doctor s office She knocks on the door No response He s not there Where can he be She continues down the hall admiring a lithograph of an th century Mississippi paddleboat along the way By this time my audience has left but I soldier on She bursts into the exam room and says Doctor doctor The doctor I should mention is a urologist with a degree from Ohio State which is where my nephew You get the idea I m an embellisher I can t leave a simple gag alone I m not the only joke challenged member of the family My sister s worse than I am Her problem She can t remember them A nurse rushes into an exam room and says Uh let me start all over again A nurse rushes into a waiting No it s not the waiting room She just came from the waiting room Let me start all over again A doctor rushes into No wait My uncle s different He s guilty of taking a perfectly fine joke and selling it as the second coming of Oscar Wilde Okay this is a good one Ready No really ready Okay fasten your seat belts Ready A nurse Got it A nurse Okay ready A nurse rushes into an exam room and says Doctor doctor there s an invisible man in the waiting room Now this is where it gets funny Ready No one is ever ready so they leave before he gets to the punch line My father s on Wall Street so he hears all the jokes before they hit the Web And he lets you know he knows them all by telling you all of them He also knows that most people don t like jokes So he slips them in under the radar I was chatting with Ben Bernanke the other day You know Ben don t you The Fed chief Anyway we were reviewing the Fed s policy on long term interest rates and he told me it had evolved into its current iteration only after a nurse rushed into an exam room and said Doctor doctor there s Hey where are you going My brother Mark understands that the secret to good joke telling is to know your audience When he entertained my grandmother s bridge club one evening he made it a point to adapt the joke to them A beautiful blonde nurse rushes into a consulting room No one in my family has ever finished this joke But as bad as it is not to be able to tell a joke there s something worse not being able to listen to one Take my cousin Mitch for example Why couldn t the doctor see him he asked Because he s invisible I said Now I didn t get that I thought the doctor couldn t see him because he was with a patient Well yeah okay but the fact that the guy was invisible Could the nurse see him No She s the one who said he was invisible How d she know he was there Because he When you say he was invisible does that mean his clothes were invisible too Here s where I tried to walk away Because if his clothes weren t invisible Mitch said stepping between me and the exit then the doctor could see him right Yeah but At least his clothes I guess Unless he was naked Okay he was naked Why would he go to his doctor naked Next time you see my family and someone is telling a joke do yourself a favor Make yourself invisible Which of the following is true according to this article A No one in the writer s family is good at telling jokes B Mark is the best at telling jokes in his family C Mitch is very sensitive to all kinds of jokes D A typically classic joke should cover all the details What is inappropriate about Mark s adaptation of the joke A He knows the audience very well B He shouldn t have entertained a bridge club C He shouldn t have begun the story with a beautiful blond nurse D He shouldn t have told old people jokes Mitch stepped between me and the exit because A he wanted to go out with me B he wanted to block my way out C he was trying to repay the situation in the consulting room D he wanted to show that the doctor could see the patient Which is the best title of the passage A

had come for him to provide against the coming winter The winter ambitions of Soapy were not of the highest In them there were no dreams of Mediterranean voyages or blue Southern skies Three months on the Island was what his soul desired Three months of assured board and bed and good company safe from north winds seemed to Soapy the most desirable thing Just as the more fortunate New Yorkers had bought their tickets to Palm Beach each winter Soapy had made his arrangements for his annual journey to the Island And now the time had come There were many institutions of charity in New York where he might receive lodging and food but to Soapy s proud spirit the gifts of charity were undesirable You must pay in humiliation of spirit for everything received at the hands of mercy So it was better to be a guest of the law Soapy having decided to go to the Island at once set about accomplishing his desire He left his bench and went up Broadway He stopped at the door of a glittering cafe He was shaven and his coat was decent If he could reach a table in the restaurant the portion of him that would show above the table would raise no doubt in the waiter s mind A roasted duck with a bottle of wine a cigar and a cup of coffee would be enough Such a dinner would make him happy for the journey to his winter refuge But as Soapy entered the restaurant door the head waiter s eye fell upon his shabby trousers and old shoes Strong hands pushed him in silence and haste out into the street Some other way of entering the desirable refuge must be found At a corner of Sixth Avenue Soapy took a stone and sent it through the glass of a glittering shop window People came running around the corner a policeman at the head of them Soapy stood still with his hands in his pockets and smiled at the sight of the policeman Where is the man that has done that asked the policeman Don t you think that I have had something to do with it said Soapy friendly The policeman paid no attention to Soapy Men who break windows don t remain to speak with policemen They run away He saw a man running and rushed after him stick in hand Soapy disgusted walked along twice unsuccessful On the opposite side of the street was a restaurant for people with large appetites and modest purses Soapy entered this place without difficulty He sat at a table and ate beefsteak and pie And then he told the waiter he had no money Go and call a cop said Soapy And don t keep a gentleman waiting No cop for you said the waiter Hey Then Soapy found himself lying upon his left ear on the pavement He arose with difficulty and beat the dust from his clothes Arrest seemed a rosy dream The Island seemed far away After another unsuccessful attempt to be arrested for harassing a young woman Soapy went further toward the district of theatres When he saw a policeman standing in front of a glittering theatre he thought of disorderly conduct On the sidewalk Soapy began to sing drunken songs at the top of his voice He danced cried and otherwise disturbed the peace The policeman turned his back to Soapy and said to a citizen It is one of the Yale boys celebrating their football victory Noisy but no harm Sadly Soapy stopped his useless singing and dancing The Island seemed unattainable He buttoned his thin coat against the north wind In a cigar store he saw a well dressed man who had set his silk umbrella by the door Soapy entered the store took the umbrella and went out with it slowly The man with the cigar followed hastily My umbrella he said Oh is it said Soapy Well why don t you call a policeman I took your umbrella Why don t you call a cop There stands one on the corner The umbrella owner slowed his steps Soapy did likewise The policeman looked at them curiously Of course said the umbrella man well you know how these mistakes occur if it s your umbrella I hope you ll excuse me I picked it up this morning in a restaurant if it s yours I hope you ll Of course it s mine said Soapy The ex umbrella man retreated The policeman hurried to help a well dressed woman across the street Soapy threw the umbrella angrily He was angry with the men who wear helmets and carry clubs They seemed to regard him as a king who could do no wrong At last Soapy stopped before an old church on a quiet corner Through one window a soft light glowed where the organist played a Sunday anthem For there came to Soapy s ears sweet music that caught and held him at the iron fence The moon was shining cars and pedestrians were few birds twittered sleepily under the roof And the anthem that the organist played cemented Soapy to the iron fence for he had known it well in the days when his life contained such things as mothers and roses and ambitions and friends The influence of the music and the old church produced a sudden and wonderful change in Soapy s soul He thought of his degraded days dead hopes and wrecked faculties And also in a moment a strong impulse moved him to battle with his desperate fate He would pull himself out of this pit he would make a man of himself again Those sweet notes had set up a revolution in him Tomorrow he would be somebody in the world He would Soapy felt a hand on his arm He looked quickly around into the broad face of a policeman What are you doing here Nothing Then come along said the policeman Three months on the Island said the Judge the next morning Which of the following is the reason for Soapy s not turning to charity A His pride gets in the way B What the institutions of charity offer isn t what Soapy needs C He wants to be a citizen who obeys the law D The institutions of charity are not located on the island From the passage we can see what the two restaurants have in common is that A they are both fancy upper class restaurants B neither of them served Soapy C they both drove Soapy out of the restaurant after he finished his meal D neither of them called cops Hearing the Sunday anthem at the church Soapy was reminded of A his good old days and wanted to play the anthem again B his unaccomplished ambition and was determined to get to the Island C his disgraceful past and determined to transform himself D his rosy dream and wished to realize it By ending the story this way the author means to A show that one always gets what he she wants with enough efforts B make a contrast and criticize the sick society C surprise readers by proving justice was done after all D put a tragic end to Soapy s life and show his sympathy for Soapy C My heart sank when the man at the immigration counter gestured to the back room I was born and raised in America and this was Miami where I live but they weren t quite ready to let me in yet Please wait in here Ms Abujaber the immigration officer said My husband with his very American last name accompanied me He was getting used to this The same thing had happened recently in Canada when I d flown to Montreal to speak at a book event That time they held me for minutes Today we were returning from a literary festival in Jamaica and I was startled that I was being sent in back once again The officer behind the counter called me up and said Miss your name looks like the name of someone who s on our wanted list We re going to have to check you out with Washington How long will it take Hard to say a few minutes he said We ll call you when we re ready for you After an hour Washington still hadn t decided anything about me Isn t this computerized I asked at the counter Can t you just look me up Just a few more minutes they assured me After an hour and a half I pulled my cell phone out to call the friends I was supposed to meet that evening An officer rushed over No phones he said For all we know you could be calling a terrorist cell and giving them information I m just a university professor I said My voice came out in a squeak Of course you are And we take people like you out of here in leg irons every day I put my phone away My husband and I were getting hungry and tired Whole families had been brought into the waiting room and the place was packed with excitable children exhausted parents even a flight attendant I wanted to scream to jump on a chair and shout I m an American citizen a novelist I probably teach English literature to your children Or would that all be counted against me After two hours in detention I was approached by one of the officers You re free to go he said No explanation or apologies For a moment neither of us moved we were still in shock Then we leaped to our feet Oh one more thing He handed me a tattered photocopy with an address on it If you weren t happy with your treatment you can write to this agency Will they respond I asked I don t know I don t know of anyone who s ever written to them before Then he added By the way this will probably keep happening each time you travel internationally What can I do to keep it from happening again He smiled the empty smile we d seen all day Absolutely nothing After telling several friends about our ordeal probably the most frequent advice I ve heard in response is to change my name Twenty years ago my own graduate school writing professor advised me to write under a pen name so that publishers wouldn t stick me in what he called the ethnic ghetto a separate secondary shelf in the bookstore But a name is an integral part of anyone s personal and professional identity just like the town you re born in and the place where you re raised Like my father I ll keep the name but my airport experience has given me a whole new perspective on what diversity and tolerance are supposed to mean I had no idea that being an American would ever be this hard The author was held at the airport because A she and her husband returned from Jamaica B her name was similar to a terrorist s C she had been held in Montreal D she had spoken at a book event We learn from the passage that the author would to prevent similar experience from happening again A write to the agency B change her name C avoid traveling abroad D do nothing Her experiences indicate that there still exists in the US A hatred B discrimination C tolerance D diversity The author sounds in the last paragraph A impatient B bitter C worried D ironic D The malls were filled with people seeking gifts for their loved ones Some of the malls remained open around the clock partly to satisfy our needs to buy gifts Behind the materialistic aspect of shopping for gifts lies the idea of caring being attentive to the desires of special people in our lives However to use a well worn play on words it is our presence not our presents that truly counts Many of us unfortunately can be so inattentive even in the presence of our loved ones that we might as well not be there at all Attention is one of the greatest gifts we can give each other Companies around the globe spend billions every year on advertising to catch our attention for just a short moment at a time Whole industries media entertainment education rely on the precious gift of our attention for their continued existence A baby lacking attention for a long time is likely to be psychologically unhealthy In earlier times both diet and attention could be left unregulated without major cause for concern There were natural checks and balances limited availability of food meant few got fat for example Similarly in bygone times we might have spent a few hours communicating with the village storyteller today watching an entire TV series while speaking to nobody is common In traditional societies with smaller population everyone would get a fair deal of attention On many issues we might go to see Grandma or Grandpa now we have Google and Wikipedia She just wants attention people tend to think little of those doing things simply for attention But the truth is that human beings need attention and giving attention to each other is to a large extent what human civilization is based upon This perhaps explains the runaway success of social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook While we use such sites for micro Hogging idea voicing and status updates the reality is that we are often doing no more or less than fulfilling our basic human drive for attention exchange I friend you you friend me I retweet you you retweet me The charming ease with which we can now get and give attention is why many people appear overly attached to their smartphones It is also a vicious circle As ever more people are busy exchanging attention online there is increasingly less attention to be paid in the real world which forces more people to seek their attention exchange online or else risk attention starvation The very nature of attention exchange is being rapidly transformed and there is a danger that some of us will develop unhealthy practices Just as eating red meat every day is a bad idea so it is with too much attention exchange The biological consequences of our technological advancement in food production are highly visible heart disease diabetes and obesity The consequences of our transformed attention exchanges will be psychological and social and so may take longer to identify but they will be equally damaging Face to face attention is becoming rarer and therefore more valuable In a sense it is priceless And it is a gift that can be given all year round In the first two paragraphs the author A offers advice to attention givers B analyses the present problems C states the necessity of presents D puts forward his point of view What can we infer from Paragraphs A More people will risk attention starvation in future B The nature of attention exchange is rarely changed C Technological advancement contributes to all diseases D Transformed attention exchanges do harm to society The writer s purpose for writing the passage is to A advocate more focus on real life attention B analyze the necessity of attention giving C give practical tips on attention exchange D recommend some social networking sites Socrates an ancient Greek philosopher Socrates was an ancient Greek philosopher who helped to shape Greek beliefs The ideas he created are present in our culture today Socrates was a person full of curiosity From the time he was a young man Socrates searched for wisdom and truth He gained wisdom by asking questions Many people in Athens thought that they had answers Socrates asked them questions and argued with them about different topics He did not think they had the knowledge they claimed to have Socrates challenged false ideas people had about things like justice love or courage He would break down the ideas people held Then he built new and more accurate ideas Socrates felt that this was what philosophy was all about Since then many great philosophers have used this method to find truth Throughout his life Socrates showed no interest in money He was also not interested in material items Socrates would allow groups of men to listen to him speak And he would never take money from them He always wore the same clothes whatever the season Socrates argued that his life was better because he had no material wealth He felt he enjoyed his food more he said he was stronger and healthier because he was not affected by the weather He believed happiness came not from having more but from wanting less By the end of the fifth century B C Athens was not a great city anymore Politicians betrayed Athens Socrates had made many people angry over the years He had always expressed his opinions when he thought laws and policies were wrong Athens had a new group of political leaders in power who didn t want to hear Socrates comments about them They thought Socrates had a bad influence on the young people of Athens Socrates was also accused of not worshipping the right gods Charges were brought against Socrates The politicians wanted to condemn Socrates to death Socrates friends told him to leave Athens They thought this was the only way for him to save his life Socrates refused He did not behave as most people in his situation would Socrates said that he had always lived by the rules of Athens and he would continue to do this He insisted on standing trial for his crime Socrates knew he was not guilty of anything The reason why he was charged was because he was different from others Although people respected him he also had made many people angry so the jury said Socrates was guilty When faced with the death penalty a person could leave Athens forever Most people chose leave rather than die Socrates was not like most people Instead of telling the jury that he would go he told them he deserved a reward Socrates believed he had done a great service by making people think Socrates said that he tried to persuade every one of you not to think of what he had but rather of what he was and how he might grow wise and good The jury did not change its mind Socrates was executed He died when he drank hemlock which is poisonous Socrates was the first great Greek philosopher He also helped to shape other philosophers that came after him Plato who got his start by studying with Socrates and Aristotle who studied with Plato also changed Western civilization Asking questions to discover the truth is still practiced today And schools even today still teach this method to students Socrates an ancient Greek philosopher Brief introduction Socrates an ancient Greek philosopher whose ideas still in our culture today Unique personalities a person who gained wisdom by asking question a simple person who spiritual health to material wealth a courage person who presented a to false ideas a thoughtful person whose new and accurate ideas other philosophers to seek truth Unfair accusations He always on laws and policies He didn t show for the right gods Glorious death form others he chose to die rather than leave Faced with death he was committed to people into thinking deeply Great Socrates was pioneer of Greek Philosophy Asking questions to discover the truth is still practiced today fertilizer n Haste Makes Waste As we all know there goes an old saying Haste Makes Waste ACBCB ACACA CBCCA BBCAB DCABB BDDDB ABDDA BCCAD AABCD

know there is an old saying Haste Makes Waste As is vividly shown in the picture the couple get astonished when seeing their crops withering dead The husband can t help losing his temper scolding his wife for her improper way of farming while the wife argues that she simply wants the crops to grow faster by fertilizing more She never thought too many fertilizers would cause the crops to die The picture clearly conveys a message that if people are eager to finish a task in a hurry the outcome may be less satisfactory and even goes to the opposite As is often the case we can t take every detail into consideration before a quick decision is made Under such circumstances we attach too much importance to quick speed at the expense of high quality which eventually contributes to greater losses Additionally more unexpected accidents may take place when we are in a hurry Remembering English words is a good case in point If you set a goal of reciting words within a short time the result may let you down for you forget them easily However if you slow down a little bit for example divide the words into several parts one part at a time and go over them frequently they can be kept longer and more easily in mind Comparing the two methods we find the latter is more efficient In conclusion haste makes waste If we can apply it to our daily life we are bound to make progress I A B C What

We were planning to drive down together to North Carolina to be with my father who was badly ill As I waited at the stop light experiencing this forced slowdown I noticed Sharper s Florist over to the left It was the same place where I had experienced many things floods of memories went through my mind as the light seemed a blessing I noticed the wine store straight ahead where my father and I had been many times before picking out the beer of the week We both liked German beer The light finally became green and I made my left turn and drove through the poor section of our hometown I remembered how each thanksgiving my family would be together I also remembered how my father would take some time out of each thanksgiving to make sure there was no one hungry in the neighborhoods surrounding where we lived I can remember as a young boy going with him to deliver some food I was scared I had never been into this part of town this deeply before My father seemed unfazed by this and went about his business The people we went to seemed to know him and gratefully accepted what he came to offer My father seemed able to give away the food in a way that honored those he was giving to This was not an arrogant act He would stop at each place and talk a little which I can remember totally pissing me off I wanted to get the hell out of there My father wanted to be sure everyone had food If there were people he found who didn t have food he would take the time to go back and get more That s the kind of man he was When the father was ill he A lived in North Carolina B gave away food to

tells the story of everything that happens to Robinson Crusoe He hopes someone will rescue him but he has been there for so long on his own that he also begins to fear being rescued Robinson Crusoe was published in Most experts believe the story is based on the life of Alexander Selkirk who was a Scottish sailor On an expedition in Selkirk had an argument with his ship s captain Selkirk thought the ship was not safe and was about to fall apart When the ship stopped at a remote island to get fresh water Selkirk got off He tried to get the other crew members to leave with him but nobody would The shop then sailed away without him Selkirk spent four years and four months on his own on the island known as Aguas Buenas Selkirk was finally rescued by a ship that visited the island in The ship s captain was grateful to Selkirk because he provided food for the crew when they arrived Now archaeologists think they have found the remains of Selkirk s camp on Aguas Buenas They found two deep holes that would have held wooden posts The archaeologists say this is evidence that Selkirk built a shelter there The post holes are near a fresh water stream They are located quite high up which would have meant that Selkirk was able to watch out for the ships coming close to the island The most interesting evidence the archaeologists say is part of a piece of equipment used by sailors to navigate Historians believe Selkirk was a navigator so the instrument could have belonged to him Robinson Crusoe was published ten years after Selkirk was rescued Most experts think Daniel Defoe heard and read stories about Selkirk which inspired him to write the book Why did Selkirk choose to land on the remote island A Because he had quarrels with the crew members B Because the captain ordered him to get fresh water C Because he wanted to go on an adventure there D Because he thought the ship he was on was in danger We can infer from the text that the ship that visited Aguas Buenas in A lost its way while sailing B lacked fresh water upon arrival C was being navigated by Selkirk D was running out of food upon arrival How could Selkirk see ships that might rescue him according to archaeologists A By asking the crew members on the ships B By sending messages to the ships captains C By watching from his shelter high on the island D By using a piece of equipment used to navigate The author wrote the text to A explain the origin of Robinson Crusoe B promote sales to Robinson Crusoe C criticise Alexander Selkrik s deeds D praise Daniel Defoe for his writing inspiration D Preventing obesity and smoking can save lives but it doesn t save money reported researchers It was a small surprise for it is against the common belief said Pieter Van Baal who led the study But it makes sense If you live longer then you cost the health system more The researchers found that from age to obese people racked up the most expensive health costs But on average healthy people lived years Smokers lived about years and obese people lived about years Smokers and obese people tended to have more heart disease than healthy people Therefore in the long run the thin and healthy group cost about from age on Smokers cost about and obese people The result throws a bucket of cold water onto the idea based on guesswork that obesity is going to cost trillions of dollars said Patrick Basham a professor of health politics If we re going to worry about the future of obesity we should stop worrying about its financial impact he said The benefits of obesity prevention may not be seen immediately in terms of cost saving in tomorrow s budget but there are long term gains said Van Baal These are often immeasurable when it comes to people living longer and healthier lives In the meanwhile he said that governments should recognize that successful smoking and obesity prevention programs mean that people will have a longer chance of dying of something more expensive later in life Lung cancer is a cheap disease to treat because people don t survive very long But if they are old enough to get Alzheimer s one day they may survive longer and cost more We are not advising that governments stop trying to prevent obesity Van Baal said But they should do it for the right reasons Among middle aged people who may cost the health system most A Those who are heavy smokers B Those who are overweight C Those who are too thin D Those who are suffering from heart attacks What can we know about the belief that obesity costs much A It turns out to be incorrect B It comes from scientific study C It is based on medical evidence D It has changed over the past years According to the text governments prevent obesity for the purpose of A reducing the risks of suffering cancer B weakening obesity s financial impact C making sure of people s long and healthy life D reducing the money spent on medical programs What would be the best title for this text A Recent Medical Study Shows Truth about Health B Preventing Obesity and Smoking May Cost More C Obesity and Smoking Lead to Expensive Diseases D Governments Change Attitude towards Obesity and Smoking E F G E A B F A C G A D How to Be Creative Most of us think that creativity is a quality belonging only to artists writers or dancers rather than ourselves The following tips are a great beginning for developing our creativity Get out of your comfort zone We eagerly accept the familiar and fear the unknown Break out of your usual patterns and welcome creativity into your life As stated earlier the human brain was designed to recognize patterns In fact our comfort zone is nothing more than a collection of patterns As we become more efficient at recognizing and using patterns we rely less on creativity to find new paths We should force ourselves out of our comfort zones and open up new possibilities Try different things If you always do what you ve always done you ll always get what you ve always got We are creatures of habits and routines and creativity hates routines If you usually drive to work take the subway for a few days Interrupt your routine experiment and try something new New things are often creative but the same old thing never is Having a great idea is not enough you must work to make it a reality Have you ever seen a new product and realized that you thought of the same thing long ago Yet someone else is making money with your idea The difference between a dreamer and a doer is action Do whatever it takes to bring your ideas to life If you can put them into practice you are well on your way to improving your creativity in all areas of your life A Take action B Seek several options C Think from the other person s point of view D If you normally eat in the office have lunch under a tree E The truth is that we are all born with the capacity to be creative F We continue to create patterns and routines for almost everything we do G We all have great ideas sometimes but only a few people turn their ideas into reality A B C D This morning after I got the news that my best friend Sean Misner who was one of the firefighters died in an Arizona wildfire in June I created a Facebook

Outdoor Adventure Center for children Louise how long have you been there W Well before I first went there two years ago I thought I d probably only stay for a year but after six months or so I really started to enjoy the job So I ve been there ever since To be honest I was lacking in self confidence and when I first arrived I was a bit worried about making mistakes I was frightened I might put the children in danger because of my inexperience M What s the best thing about your work W One thing I like is seeing them have so much fun even if sometimes their behavior isn t perfect And I can suggest activities that haven t been tried before But there are always some children who haven t quite got as much ability as others and for me the most rewarding part of the job is getting them to succeed in things they haven t managed to do before It s hard work though Sometimes you are on duty at night M Mm What do you think about that W Well I can t say I look forward to starting work at p m

the beach at sunset No one tells us that the greatest moments of a lifetime are short unplanned and nearly always catch us off guard Not long ago as I was reading a bedtime story to my seven year old daughter Annie I became aware of her focused look She was staring at me with a faraway blank expression Apparently completing The Tale of Samuel Whiskers was not as important as we first thought I asked what she was thinking about Mommy she whispered I just can t stop looking at your pretty face I almost dissolved on the spot Little did she know how many trying moments the glow of her sincerely loving statement would carry me through over the following years Not long after I took my four year old son to an elegant department store where the sweet notes of a classic love song drew us toward a tuxedoed musician playing a grand piano Sam and I sat down on a marble bench nearby and he seemed as astonished by the pleasant theme as I was I didn t realize that Sam had stood up next to me until he turned took my face in his little hands and said Dance with me If only those women walking under the Paris moon knew the joy of such an invitation made by a round cheeked boy with baby teeth Although shoppers openly chuckled and pointed at us as we glided and whirled around the open space I would not have traded a dance with such a charming young gentleman if I d been offered the universe From the passage we know A Annie knew how important she was to her mother B shoppers didn t notice the author dancing with her son C there are bedtime stories in the Tale of Samuel Whiskers D Sam was not surprised at the music which was played in the store When the author knew her daughter could not stop looking at her pretty face she felt A sad B deeply moved C annoyed D ashamed Why wouldn t the author trade a dance with her son even if she was given the world A Because she knew she wouldn t be given the universe B Because her son was the most important person to her C Because she thought she was the happiest one at the moment D Because it was very important for the author to dance with her son What does the author want to prove by showing two examples of her kids A Her kids love her very much B She enjoys staying with her kids C The greatest moments of a lifetime always come unexpectedly D Those women walking under the moon should enjoy the happiness with kids C On the banks of Tanzania s Lake Eyasi lives the world s last hunter gatherer tribe the Hadza They don t grow food raise animals or build houses Instead they live a life unchanged for more than ten thousand years Their world is one of complete freedom something modern society can barely imagine and is unlikely to ever experience let alone have the skills to stay alive Text messages and phone calls don t exist Nor do cars and electricity No jobs timetables and social structures No laws taxes and unbelievably no money the closest thing to currency is the trade for a pair of shorts with a neighboring tribe We spent our time with the Hadza hunting baboons a daily activity for the men Their land is packed with sharp bushes poisonous snakes and man eating lions But a successful hunting trip is the difference between eating or going hungry The Hadza diet consists mainly of honey fruit and meat Men often hunt in pairs to shoot animals with bows and arrows The Hadza show us how to track animals from baboons to snakes to lions They are hugely skilled with their handmade bows and arrows we have a go and barely get the arrow to go three feet in front of us The language of the Hadza is believed to be the oldest still spoken language known to man The Hadza don t have conflict and have no memory of starvation Their population never reaches numbers that cannot be supported through hunting or gathering They never get from their land more than they need Unlike modern day office workers the Hadza enjoy an extraordinary amount of free time Their work hunting for food takes up around five hours of their day They ve been in such a state of peaceful existence for thousands of years We can learn from the text that the Hadza A lead a very primitive life B live on traditional agriculture C have their own system of currency D show a lot of interest in new technology Which of the following can describe the Hadza s environment A Stressful B Comfortable C Exciting D Dangerous The relationship between the Hadza and nature A is going wrong B is full of conflict C is in perfect harmony D is changing all the time Why does the author come to visit the Hadza A To study their native language B To get to know their way of life C To learn survival skills from them D To persuade them to protect animals D Fear is hardly a new parental felling of course But the fear of letting our children out of sight for even a second that s new And it feeds not only on reasonable worry but also on a ste ady diet of pressure powerful cultural pressures encourage parents to regard every childhood experience from the standpoint of the worst possible outcome says Paranoid Parenting author Frank Furedi To do otherwise is to be seen as an inesponsible parent I received an e mail about a father who s following his daughter s field trip to make sure she s safe and even a mother in New York City admits that she won t let her daughter go to the mailbox alone as she s afraid someone may kidnap her daughter How did this happen TV says Trevor Butterworth an editor at a media group TV exists to scare you Thanks to a steady stream of those stories it starts to feel as if kidnappings are happening all the time in any car near you But they re not says sociologist David Finkelhor Crimes against kids are down to levels we haven t seen since the early s The fact is children times more likely to die in a ear accident and that doesn t stop us from driving them to school But we blame parents for letting anything happen to their children The sympathetic TV host will ask Why Why did you let her go to her piano lesson alone That s why the story about my nine year old son Izzy riding on the subway by himself was fun he said Plus being on national TV meant that be missed math class Sometimes it really pays to be brave Frank Furedi s words in Para I suggest that A parents are under Pressure to see the dark side of society B the fear Of kids absence is common for parents C it s hard to become a responsible parent D people are forced to protect their kids The example of a father and a mother are used to show A parents are fearfu about kids s safety B parents should strictly limit their kids

accidents B is focusing too much on crimes against kids C fails to guide parents in kids education D make up stories about kidnappings What can be the best tiile for the text Top tips from Starbucks

D In winter I often walk in a nearby park during lunch time The park is quiet as people have the time to enjoy the winter sun on a weekday The two people that are often seen are a middle aged father and his little daughter her school uniform The father looks like he has all the time in the world he to hurry along the jogging path instead he matches his pace with of the little girl Sometimes they are lying in the sun laughing and chatting The man certainly doesn t look What sort of job can he have that gives him the flexibility to walk in the park in the middle of the day And today we sat on the rocks and had a little chat You enjoy the park very much to come here so often I said The father nodded How I asked curiously do you to leave your office to be with your daughter every day The story that the father Satyendra Dugbey told me showed me how if we under the surface even ordinary people s life can be quite I used to be no different from any of those thousands of office workers to

daughter from school which was just next door to his working place and took her to the park It was actually a very small change he d made he said but it amazed him every day to see the difference it

fortieth birthday approaches inevitable as a new hair do I realize how many women friends I ve had over the years Most have come and gone with the changes of life just like the latest shoe fashions waltz in and out of my closet Some of my friends like some of my shoes were silly mistakes They never did fit properly and they always felt slightly off no matter how hard I tried to fit my feet into them Others were my absolute favorite for a while but they wore out or wore off All style and no substance the quality just wasn t there Then there are my true friends the ones who like a pair of fine shoes never go out of style or out of favor whose appeal and value just increase with wear and time These are friends who stay in touch and stand by me as if they and I have never gone off to a new state or a new job Physical distance does not separate us time does not change the fundamental fact of our friendship the wear and tear of life does not stop us The sole still support us the colors and lines still please us the uppers still strong but grown soft gently bent around feet Our connection is securely fastened unaffected by the whirlwind of changes we ve each been through even when life carries us in different directions If the comparison fits Deborah is the evening shoe elegant and lovely She appreciates the finer things choose only the best and still looks polished long after the rest of us have drooped She is a study in elegance and knows the difference between bone and winter white From this splendid treasure I ve come to recognize my own appreciation for the finer things in life and to the realization that I deserved them Jane is that pair of essential timeless pumps that I wear often and would be lost without With this classic my basic needs and comfort level are assured leaving me time and energy for fun I can move gracefully from day to night from work to play from jokes to discussion My step is light laughter comes easily and I am ready for adventure Georgiana is my pair of standard white Keds familiar comfortable and good for all seasons I ve had them since long before They are part of my childhood They take me home and I am a kid again diving into the ocean on a hot summer day They have been up the hill and through the mud with me They keep me moving forward even when putting one foot in front of the other feels like the hardest thing I ve ever done I know I can slip them tomorrow and all days after I am indebted to these lovely worn sneakers In the shoe rack of life these are the friends I cherish They are the base upon which I stand They accompany me on my chosen path regardless of where it leads or how bumpy or winding it gets The writer s fortieth birthday was mentioned as a n A explanation for her buying new shoes B

Whether you re in the mood for poetry essay or fiction the recommendations below include some examples of classics perfectly suited for November Mont Blanc by Percy Shelley In this one of Shelley s most famous poems the poet is investigating problems of mental freedom and self positioning The awe and wonder of nature as a projection of the mind s own limitless power is an appropriate theme for this time of year We can perhaps think about our place in the universe as we watch the leaves turn listen to the wind blow and prepare for the snowy and peaceful moments to arrive in coming months Such as a feeble brook will often assume In the wild woods among the mountains lone Where waterfalls around it leap for ever Where woods and winds contend and a vast river Over its rocks ceaselessly bursts and raves Lines Walden by Henry David Thoreau Walden combines autobiography with social critique It is partly a memoir of Thoreau s experience living in a place not too far from town The book explores themes of self reliance simplicity and progress while criticizing consumerism and contemporary Western culture We might wonder about reading a book about living in nature at a time when the months are becoming colder but the comfort of Walden the reflection as well as the ease it inspires are perfect for this time of year I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if I could not learn what it had to teach and The Eve of St Agnes by John Keats The Eve of St Agnes is a long poem It was written in but not published until It is widely considered to be amongst his finest poems and was influential in th century literature Although the poem refers to the evening before St Agnes s day January th readers especially in the northern hemisphere may appreciate experiencing this one on a chilly night perhaps one of the first of the mid autumn season ST AGNES Eve Ah bitter chill it was The owl for all his feathers was a cold The hare limp d trembling through the frozen grass And silent was the flock in woolly fold Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens There s just something about Dickens that makes you want to read him in the autumn It may be too early for a book like A Christmas Carol but Oliver Twist is perfect for late November reading The story introduces us to a sickly orphaned boy living in an English workhouse Oliver weak and hungry dares to ask for more food For this insolence he s exiled and must suffer various hardships before finally finding solace with a caring family Although I am not disposed to maintain that being born in a workhouse is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being I do mean to say that in this particular instance it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that According to the passage reading Mont Blanc can help us A learn something about the miserable life of an orphan B appreciate experiencing the atmosphere of chilly nights C try to find our own position in this world D inspire us to experience living simply and easily Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage A Both Mont Blanc and the Eve of Saint Agnes are not collections of poems B Walden by Henry David Thoreau was intended for naturalists C The Eve of St Agnes by Keats was written much later than A Christmas Carol by Dickens D All the works were produced in November For each masterpiece the added original lines and sentences aim to A tell something about the background of the work B introduce the writing style of the work C keep the readers more informed about the writer D help the readers have a taste of the masterpieces The four masterpieces are arranged A according to time B at random C in the order of the letters D according to influence C Reading unlike speaking is a young activity to some degree Humans have been speaking in some form for hundreds of thousands of years we are born with the ability to acquire speech The earliest writing however came only years ago and every act of reading remains a version of what my son is learning identifying letters and words use much the same of brain as we use to identify trees cars animals and telephone boxes It s not only letters and words that we process as objects Texts themselves so far as our brain is concerned are physical landscapes So it is not surprising that we respond differently to words printed on a page compared to words appearing on a screen For her new book Words Onscreen The Fate Of Reading in a Digital World professor Naomi Baron conducted a survey of reading preference among over universities across the world When given a choice between media ranging from printouts to smart phones laptops desktops and e readers of the respondents replied that it was hard copy that best allowed them to concentrate This isn t a result likely to surprise many editors or anyone else who works closely with text While writing this article I gathered my thoughts through a version of the same principle having collected and checked my notes onscreen I printed said notes wrote all over the resulting printout argued with myself in the margins placed marks next to key points and then draw my own clear conclusion Across three experiments in researchers Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer compared the effectiveness of students taking hand notes versus typing onto laptops Their conclusion the relative slowness of writing by hand demands heavier mental lifting forcing students to sum up rather than to quote therefore tending to increase the students ability of understanding applying and memorizing In other words reading from paper is good at least as far as the brain is concerned Moreover the handwriting itself can be significant In a study at Indiana University professor Karin James tested five year old children who didn t know how to read or write by asking them to reproduce a letter or a shape in one of the three ways typed on to the computer drawn on a blank sheet or copied over dotted lines When the children were drawing freehand their brain had the similar activities to adults reading and writing The other two methods showed no such brain activities Similar effects have been found in other tests suggesting not only a close link between reading and writing but that the experience of reading itself differs between letters learned through handwriting and those learned through typing A conclusion was drawn that handwriting tends to lift up our brain more than the placeless weightless scrolling of words on screen However there is also a scientific recognition that many of the screen s advantages search boundless and bottomless capacity links and leaps and seamless navigation are either unhelpful or destructive when it comes to certain kinds of reading and writing Above all it seems to me we must give up the concept that there is only one way of reading or that technology and paper can never be put together We re lucky enough to have more opportunities to make our choice What does the writer probably mean by saying Reading is a young activity in Paragraph A Reading is an activity for children B Reading develops your brain into being young C Reading came into being just recently D Reading was applied by humans later than speaking According to the passage reading from paper does not mean reading from A hard copy B printouts C iPhone D journals Reading from paper is more helpful for concentrating because A it is a young activity to a degree B it involves more brain activities than its opponents C it demands more physical lifting D it has boundless and bottomless search capacity The study at Indiana in Paragraph was intended to A deny the three experiments by Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer B offer a more convincing evidence of the writer s point of view C show how powerful our children s reading capacity can be D echo or support the survey conducted by professor Naomi Baron The writer s attitude towards handwriting can be best described as A tolerant B negative C neutral D positive She was working on some history essay Her books were open on the desk and she had an A pad there and some pencils ready for taking notes As I watched she sat back on her chair and she took up her history book But much as she tried to read it and much as she tried to concentrate her eyes kept glancing up at those old photographs There were a photograph of me on my own and a photograph of the two of us together There was also a photo of when Eggy was small and when I was only a baby maybe I had even just been born And she was holding me with Dad s help while Mom looked on rather nervously as if worried that Eggy might drop me on my head Then there were photos of her and me both of us getting bigger and older And she was always three years ahead of me always my big sister and I was always her naughty little brother driving her nuts and getting her on her nerves There was a photograph of all of us too of me and Eggy and Mum and Dad all standing there together smiling at the new camera There I was And there we were And nothing would ever bring us back or make us whole again I felt so sad again but I wouldn t give in to it I was on a mission like they say and I had to see it through I had to settle the unfinished business I had to forgive and be forgiven I couldn t let Eggy go through the rest of her life remembering those last words she d ever said to me just before I stormed out to get run over by a truck You ll be sorry one day when I am dead I said to her No I won t be she d shouted after me I ll be glad And then I d never come back Eggy I said Eggy it s Harry I am here right by you Right here But don t be afraid It s OK Eggy I am a ghost now that s all But it s OK it s nothing to be frightened of I am not going to haunt you for ever I just came back to work things out with you to say I am sorry Can you hear me Eggy Do you know I am here But she looked back down at her history book reached out and turned a page over And she didn t know that I was standing right behind her so close that I could reach out and touch her I am touching your shoulder Eggy Can you feel my hand Can you It s me Harry Don t be afraid I am just touching your shoulder that s all But she went on reading the history book and then paused and took up one of the pencils and made a few notes about Henry the Eighth and all the wives he once had and why he had them Eggy it s me Eggy Nothing She looked up from her book daydreaming maybe like you do in the middle of your homework Her eyes fell on the photos of her and me at my fourth birthday party My getting ready to blow out all the candles Her getting ready to help me in case I ran out of air Oh Harry she said Oh Harry And she reached out and touched the photo just like it was flesh and blood but not just I saw the pencil on the desk I remembered the leaf on the tree Jelly s Parker and Arthur with the fruit machine I could do it I knew I could I had to I focused my thoughts on the pencil all of them every part of me I tried to shine my thoughts upon it as if they were the beam of a torch Please I thought please please please How many photographs do you think there are on Eggy s desk at least A B C D The unfinished business mentioned in Paragraph probably means A having more photos taken with Eggy B expressing his being sorry to Eggy C saying good bye to Eggy D returning the school things to Eggy Which of the following ways of writing impresses you most in the story A Giving a definition B Giving an example C Repeated words D Making a comparison Which of the following can be put in the blank in the story A paper and chemicals B tears and laughter C life and death D trial and error It can be inferred from the passage that at the end of the story Harry probably will A write something B take away the pencil C steal the pencil D break off the pencil angrily What might be the best title for the passage A A Trustworthy Brother B An Unforgettable Accident C A Regular Guest D A Special Mission A B C D E F A Enjoy meeting new people B Live in the moment C Expect the unexpected D Appreciate the life you have E Relax and Have Fun F Respect other cultures Traveling has many benefits It s no wonder that so many people love to travel and some even consider traveling as part of their routine lifestyle Perhaps the reasons for people from all walks of life both old and young enjoying traveling are as follows You never know what is going to happen when you are traveling When you are an inexperienced traveler you are immediately thrown into a situation where you do not always know what to do It s easy to become anxious when you don t know what is coming up next but just be patient and let things unfold Flights will be delayed or you might not know where your next meal is coming from Be prepared financially for unexpected things because you will probably spend more money than you planned on Experienced travelers learn very quickly to adapt to new situations and environments It may be easy to forget that you are there to relax and enjoy yourself Relaxation is one of the top benefits of travel Just enjoy wherever you are and take things in as they happen You will learn unexpected things that way So you might as well relax wherever you are and have a good time especially when things do not go as planned Being in new countries and around strangers all the time can be stressful and make you uncomfortable But you should have faith that most people you meet will be pleasant to deal with Your attitude is the most important thing when you meet new people You may not be able to understand them but you will gain the most if you just show them respect as human beings Learn how to enjoy being around new people and don t be afraid to talk to them Most people are used to doing the same routine in their lives We get used to our jobs our friends and our usual places that we go for fun Traveling takes you away from all that but it makes you feel more alive You learn to trust your instincts in a new situation and allow yourself to just appreciate each moment for what it is You see things you have never seen before When you learn to be in the moment of right now you are more aware of everything going on around you When you travel outside of your world you will notice right away the cultural differences People might dress differently They might communicate in a language you don t know and their lives may appear to be so unfamiliar to you Here you learn to respect who people are You see them and acknowledge that they live in a world apart from you It makes you think about the world on a bigger scale It makes you more aware of some of the ways that other people struggle in their lives On the first day of her new job Alice arrived in a quarter to nine She took the lift to the eleventh floor and the secretary showed

Netherlands on Monday introduced its first ever intelligent bicycle fitted with electronic devices to help bring down the high accident rate among elderly cyclists in the bicycle mad country Developed for the government by the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research TNO the intelligent bicycle runs on electricity A commercial available bicycle is expected to be on the market in the next two years and should sell for between to euros per bicycle The devices on the bike are linked through an onboard computer with a vibrating warning system fitted in the bicycle s saddle and handlebars to warn cyclists of the coming danger The saddle vibrates when other cyclists approach from behind while the handlebars do the same when barriers appear ahead Accidents often happen when cyclists look behind them or get a fright when they are passed at high speed said Maurice Kwakkernaat one of TNO s research scientists involved in the project The onboard system technology has already been at work in the car industry he said More and more elderly people are using a bicycle not only for short distances but also for longer distances Dutch Environment and Infrastructure Minister Melanie Schultz van Haegen told AFP This type of bicycle is truly needed in the Netherlands because it will help us bring down the number of elderly people who are injured every year and allow them to continue to enjoy cycling she said In the Netherlands bicycles outnumber the population of million by at least one million and there are some km of bicycle path in the country Those statistics are set to grow as more and more people take to two wheeled transport leading to an increased risk of injury Last year cyclists died in the country of which or were older than according to the Central Statistics Office The year before cyclists died the majority of victims also being elderly The current model weighs kilograms but researchers are working on making the onboard systems smaller The intelligent bicycle is aimed to A protect the environment B help reduce traffic pressure C popularize the use of bicycles D improve safety for elderly cyclists Which part of the intelligent bicycle will vibrate when another cyclist was suddendly found ahead A The handlebars B The wheels C The saddle D The onboard computer We can learn from the passage that A the elderly ride bicycles wherever they go B the accident rate among elderly cyclists is high C the number of elderly cyclists is decreasing D the elderly are planning to give up cycling Which is the best title for the passage A A Test Bicycle B Elderly Cyclists C A Smart Bicycle D A Bicycle mad Country C An American woman has been held by authorities in China for the past six months accused of stealing state secrets Mrs Phan Gillis a naturalised American born in Vietnam was detained in March during a trade visit to promote the Texan city of Houston Sandy Phan Gillis s husband Jeff Gillis says she is now being moved to a more secure facility China s Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said on Tuesday that Mrs Phan Gillis was suspected of carrying out activities endangering national security and is currently being investigated by relevant departments We hope that the outside world will respect China s handling of this case according to law he added Mrs Phan Gillis was president of the Houston Shenzhen Sister City Association and consulted for Chinese and US businesses One of her colleages in the trip told the BBC there was nothing out of the ordinary about the trip but described the sequence of events as they left China as bizarre They had been travelling around China for about a week when the group went through immigration control at the border between Guangdong and Macau in Zhuhai on March The group became separated regrouping on the other side without Mrs Phan Gillis After returning to Houston several days later Mr Gillis told them that the US consulate had informed him his wife had been detained accused of stealing state secrets Her family vigorously deny the accusations which they say have never been properly explained Since then consular officials have been able to visit Mrs Phan Gillis periodically to check up on her health which her husband says is poor and to pass on messages The US embassy in Beijing would not comment on the story and referred the BBC to the US Department of State in Washington which was closed at the time of enquiry What do we know about Mrs Phan Gillis according to the passage A A Vietnamese who goes to China on business B She went on a trade visit with her husband C A consultant for Chinese and US businesses of the Houston Shenzhen Sister City Association D An American who has been held by Chinese government What is the attitude of China s authorities toward this issue A Mrs Phan Gillis is guilty of stealing China s state secrets B They do not confirm the investigation of Mrs Phan Gillis C Whether Mrs Phan Gillis is guilty or not is still under investigation D They are expecting other countries intervene What is the American government s reaction to this event A positive B negative C unclear D neutral What can we infer from the passage A The family of Mrs Phan Gillis think she is innocent B The Chinese relevant governments are using some illegal methods to get things done C Mrs Phan Gillis have been to China for many times D Mrs Phan Gillis was detained during a trade visit to promote the Texan city of Houston D Like many old towns in the forested valleys of the Northwest Albany Ore has seen its share of ups and downs over the years but when the local economy began to decline some years ago the downs seemed to outnumber the ups Albany was changing completely We had to find a way to reinvent ourselves says Wendy Kirbey the former owner of a coffee shop downtown So in Kirbey proposed a project she hoped would help her town rediscover its pride a Victorian style carousel the animals carved by the townspeople themselves It felt like the perfect fit for our historical town she says Despite a sceptical city council and a starting budget of only Kfrbey and a handful of volunteers got to work Ten years later more than people have spent nearly hours on the Albany Carousel making a lively herd of unusual creatures Each of the animals has been adopted by a sponsor who oversees its creation and often adds a personal touch The project has shown the diverse skills and creative talents of Albany pop The amazing thing about this attempt is that whenever we ve needed something it s been provided for us says Kirbey Somebody s aunt knows somebody s uncle who comes down to lend a hand Kirbey says it will take two more years to complete the project But the carousel is already working its magic It is our town s No attraction says Rod Porsche of the Albany Visitors Association As the animals are completed they re put on show in local hotels restaurants and shops people who come to see the fantastical figures around town and tour the workshop as many as visitors a month are helping Albany with its economic recovery I can t imagine how great it s going to be when the carousel is up and running Porsche says What can we learn about the carousel A It cost a fortune B It looks very modern C It received support from all walks of life D It took ten years to build By saying the underlined sentence Kirbey wants to tell us A the townspeople are closely linked B it is a small world C uncles and aunts make great efforts D help is at hand What can we infer from the last paragraph A Porsche has made an outstanding contribution to Albany B Porsche is sceptical of the town s attractions C Porsche has made many friends through the project D Porsche thinks highly of the project The text is mainly about A how a struggling town found a way to create a little magic B the ups and downs of Albany C how the carousel would help a town recover its culture D the creative talents of Albany The benefits of keeping a journal If you want to grow one important thing you should do is keeping a journal It may seem simple but it can make a big difference in your life I have been keeping journals for years Writing all the lessons I learn and all the ideas I get has become a habit for me Here are some benefits you will get by keeping a journal It prevents you from losing an idea Have you ever gotten an idea only to lose it later because you didn t write it down But then I developed the habit of writing down every idea that came into my mind as soon as possible If I m away from my computer I usually write it down on a piece of paper that I bring wherever I go I will then transfer the idea to the journal in my computer It helps you review all the lessons you ve learned By reviewing your journal you can quickly see the lessons you ve learned and the ideas you ve gotten You can use the ideas to propel yourself forward After keeping a journal for years you can look back at it and see how far you ve gone Things that were big problems in the past might seem small today The raw ideas you had in the past might have been realized today It helps you expand your ideas When you try to come up with a sentence to express an idea you are thinking actively about it In the end you will expand your ideas A I often experienced that myself B It trains you to express your thoughts C It allows you to see your progress over time D Just use whatever tool you feel comfortable with E Thinking actively helps you connect your idea to another idea F And to be honest I can t imagine what my life would be like without it G Then you can do whatever necessary to avoid repeating the same mistakes A B C D Kidnappers are rarely interested in animals but they recently took considerable interests in Mrs

universities And they needn t change their lifestyle too much Seventy percent of them would like to choose universities in other provinces Being away from home they can become more independent and

an astronomy fan chances are that you can easily recognize certain constellations and stars such as the Big Dipper and the North Star The North Star is the brightest star in the constellation known as the Little Dipper It is so called because of the special position If you were to stay up all night looking at the stars you d slowly see them move around a point in the sky known as the North Celestial Pole You would notice however that one star remains still This is the North Star so named for its location almost directly in line with the North Celestial Pole Due to its position in the sky at one time sailors used the North Star as a navigational tool By measuring the angle between the northern horizon and the North Star a navigator could accurately determine the ship s latitude But latitude or the imaginary lines stretching across the globe parallel to the equator was not enough to plot a ship s location Knowing latitude only allowed navigators to locate themselves on a particular latitude line at a particular distance from the equator It was only with the invention of a way to accurately measure longitude that precise navigation became possible Although the North Star is no longer used by navigators it remains a heavenly symbol of human curiosity and exploration Which of the following statements about the North Star is TRUE A The North Star is the brightest star in the night sky B The North Star together with some other stars make up the Little Dipper C The North Star moves along the same course with other stars D The North Star is exactly located in line with the North Celestial Pole What can be inferred from the passage A The North Star could help navigators set a straight course of their ship in the past B Real lines that are parallel to the equator are called latitude C Either latitude or longitude could make precise navigation possible D Now the North Star is no longer a navigational tool used by sailors Which is probably the best title of the passage A What is a navigational tool B What can be called the earliest GPS C What makes the North Star so special D What is the symbol of human exploration Red envelops have related to the Chinese Lunar New Year for long I myself have had plenty of experiences both receiving and giving our red envelops in the past and I mean who doesn t love free money I m truly surprised by the degree of people s obsession with red envelops this year In fact everyone I know spent at least a day or two crazily shaking their smart phones Thanks to messaging app WeChat s new feature that allows users to send money electronically grabbing red envelopes has never seemed so easy Just in case you are one of the very few people who still can t be involved in the game Givers link their WeChat to their bank accounts and then they can send specified amounts of money to their WeChat contacts through a personal message They can also put the cash up for grabs in chat group full of friends and anyone who acts fast enough will get a share Later receivers can transfer the funds from their WeChat back into their own bank accounts I m always for some harmless fun in life so my natural response would be why not Moreover I ve always believed that it s human nature to want free stuff regardless of whether you actually need it or not This may not be a good quality but it s not against the law so I won t get all judgmental here I really can t blame anyone for their enthusiasm in grabbing red envelops I would have done it too had I not thought linking WeChat to my bank accounts was too much trouble A Considering these reasons B here s how it works C generally speaking it s been fun D In theory this sounds like a fun game E In terms of all the advantages above F mostly trying to get as much as

honest in the exam taking will begin correcting the biggest problems facing the education system high school graduates who are not ready fill jobs The system has long produced graduates who lack the skills employers need Also there is another program aim at improving education for women As for the Class of they will soon find out whether those efforts helped Recently the Ministry of Education has issued a requirement which students should be given labor education while at the school which arouses a heated debate As for students opinion are divided Some students think that it will be great benefit for their health enabled them to be well developed On the other hand some students hold the view that this kind of education will take up our time which will be spent studying otherwise But it will have a negative effect on their grades It was true that students are given little chance of laboring nowadays thus lacking the sense of labor So as far as I am concerned students definite should

ordinary people However mobile phones can bring some problems Recently I made a research on the phenomenon that drivers tend to play with their mobile phones while driving of the interviewees find it common that drivers use their phones while driving owe it to the driver s overconfidence in their driving skills Furthermore highly recommend severe punishment As far as I am concerned drivers should not play with their mobile phones when driving Much attention on phones can distract them from driving and lead to traffic accidents What s more serious road accidents can cause injuries and deaths

by Galileo and Copernicus who no doubt considered Aristotle to be a total fool He concluded by stating I find certain scientists to be the most people I know generally totally and convinced that they have the answer to all problems In my mind a reasonably person is the fellow who recognizes that life is little more than a lot of questions answers and one answer should only lead to another question

temperature humidity and nutrient availability seem to have trumped the benefits of increased carbon dioxide said researchers from the National University of Singapore percent of the species studied now reach smaller adult sizes than they did in the past The researchers point out that warmer temperatures and changing habitats caused by climate change are possible reasons for the shrinking of creatures We do not yet know the exact mechanisms involved or why some organisms are getting smaller while others are unaffected the researchers said Until we understand more we could be risking negative consequences that we can t yet quantify The change was big in cold blooded animals Only two decades of warmer temperatures were enough to make reptiles smaller An increase of only caused nearly a percent increase in metabolism Greater use of energy resulted in tiny tortoises and little lizards Fish are smaller now too Though overfishing has played a part in reducing numbers experiments show that warmer temperatures also stop fish growth There is a recent report on warmer temperatures negative effects on plankton the base of the marine ecosystem Warm blooded animals weren t immune from the size change caused by climate change Many birds are now smaller Mammals have been miniaturized too Soay sheep are thinner Red deer are weaker And polar bears are smaller compared with historical records This isn t the first time this has happened in Earth s history million years ago a warming event similar to the current climate change caused bees spiders and ants to shrink by to percent over several thousand years That event happened over a longer time than the current climate change The speed of modern climate change could mean organisms may not respond or adapt quickly enough especially those with long generation times So it is likely that more negative influences of climate change will be shown in the future Which of the following would be the best title for the passage A Why do some species become smaller B How does climate change in Earth s history C Climate change has many negative effects D Species become smaller as climate warms The underlined word trumped in the first paragraph can be replaced by A increased B beaten C strengthened D equaled Researchers from the National University of Singapore believe that A how climate change affects animals sizes has not been found clearly B all the animals on the Earth have become smaller C too many studies on animals sizes have been done D climate change has more negative effects on warm blooded animals What can we learn from the passage A Climate change has even affected plankton negatively B Birds have suffered more from climate change than fish C Cold blooded animals become smaller because of the lack of food D The warming event has never happened in Earth s history before The Pew report which was based on surveys carried out in Britain France Germany Italy Spain Greece Poland and the Czech Republic concluded that the European Union was the new sick man of Europe The percentage of Europeans with a favorable view of the EU has plunged from percent last year to percent now The UK may be considered the most Eurosceptic country but its support for the union has barely changed in the past months slipping only two points to percent By contrast France s backing for the EU has slipped sharply from percent last year to percent today On the question of whether to remain in the EU percent of the British want to leave the union and surprisingly the same percentage went to stay The Pew report s authors said The long drawn economic crisis has created bad forces that are pulling European public opinion apart separating the French from the Germans and Germans from everyone else They added The effort over the past half century to create a more united Europe is now the main disaster of the euro crisis The European project now stands in a bad reputation across much of Europe The only European leader rated highly by their own voters was the German Chancellor Angela Merkel with percent voters in favor of her Prime Minister David Cameron was the next highest with a positive score of percent among the British public although he can take some comfort from the fact that percent of Poles and half of all French people think he is doing a good job In spite of the dark economic future and growing doubt of the EU there were strong majorities of more than percent in favor of keeping the euro in the five countries surveyed that use the single currency Which of the following is TRUE about the recent Pew report A The UK has the smallest number of people against the EU B There s a slight change of the UK s support for the EU C More than half the Germans raise doubt about the EU D A vast majority of French people are in favor of the EU As to whether to remain in the EU A the British are divided equally B few British want to stay C half British want to leave D many British don t care about it What s the Pew report s authors attitude towards the relation between France and Germany A Enthusiastic B Optimistic C Negative D Neutral Why does Prime Minister David Cameron feel a little bit comfortable A Only a score of percent of Britons go against him B Many of the Poles and French think well of him C More than percent of the Europeans are in favor of keeping the euro D Angela Merkel has percent voters supporting her Loch Ness the largest freshwater lake in the British Isles is twenty four miles long and at one point one mile wide It has an average depth of four hundred and fifty feet and at times drops close to a thousand It is cold and murky with dangerous currents In short it is the perfect place to hide a monster from even the sharpest eyes of science The Loch Ness Monster also called Nessie is supposedly living in this area The earliest recorded sighting of the Loch Ness Monster was in the biography of Life of St Columba by Adamnan in the year AD The monster apparently attacked a man who was swimming in the River Ness The monster didn t make headlines again until August when fishermen reported seeing a creature with feet long approaching their boat throwing water in the air In after a new road was built along the edge of the Loch the number of reports rose suddenly Early in Author Grant a young student was out on his motorcycle one evening when he almost ran into the monster as it crossed the road Grant s description of the thing small head long thin neck and tail with a big body seemed to match the appearance of the plesiosaur an aquatic type of dinosaur that has been extinct for million years The Loch Ness Investigation Bureau was formed in to act as a research organization for information about the creature Even now efforts have continued to find the monster A great deal of information was discovered about the Loch but they haven t yet to produce any specific evidence of a monster Skeptics argue that the water in the Loch is too cold for a plesiosaur to live in They also argue that an air breathing animal like a whale or seal would spend much more time on the surface than the creature seems to and would be spotted more often Some scientists have wondered if the sightings might be caused by an underwater wave which is known to sometimes occur in deep long and cold lakes like Loch Ness Such a wave might push debris to the surface that might look like a strange animal However none of these is identified According to the skeptics which of the following is TRUE A It is impossible for a monster to live in cold water B The Loch Ness Monster often stays under the water C The Loch Ness Monster is an air breathing animal D There is no so called monster in Loch Ness The purpose of setting up the Loch Ness Investigation Bureau is to A research the plesiosaur in the Loch Ness B protect the Nessie in the lake C collect some information about the Nessie D catch the Loch Ness Monster Which of the following is the correct order for the things that happened in the passage a A young student met with a monster crossing the road b A swimmer was attacked by a monster in Loch Ness c A new road was built along the edge of the Loch d The Loch Ness Investigation Bureau was set up e Three fishermen saw a creature swimming towards their boat A b e c a d B a b e d c C b d a c e D d c e b a We can infer from the passage that A Nessie is an aquatic type of dinosaur B Nessie has a foot long body C Nessie is an underwater wave D Nessie is still a mystery What does this passage mainly talk about A The natural scenery of Loch Ness B The Nessie C Skeptics opinions on Loch Ness Monster D The Loch Ness Investigation Bureau s research results The Age of Unreason Charles Handy In his book The Age of Unreason Professor Handy describes the dramatic changes that are taking place in our lives today and warns that we must adapt to these changes if we want to survive in the future Handy believes that in the future less than of the workforce will be employed full time by an organization These full time employees will be the qualified professionals technicians and managers who are essential to an organization Their working lives will be a lot more demanding than today but in return they will be well paid and they will retire earlier The rest of the workforce will be self employed or will work part time providing organizations with the products and services they require on a contract basis Handy forecasts a big increase in the number of working mothers in the future and believes there will be a large number of unemployed Handy gives us plenty of figures to worry about He estimates that by the year one person in five will retire and one in ten will be over seventy five years old There will be one retiree to every three people of working age and even more than that in countries such as Germany and Switzerland where the proportion will be as much as one to two Retirees will remain healthy and active for longer than they do today and many will live to be a hundred years old a fact which leads Handy to suggest that the term retirement will no longer be appropriate He suggests the third age is a more appropriate description since it will be as important a part of our lives as the first age of learning and the second age of working are for us today Professor Handy wrote the book most probably to A warn us of potential social problems in the future B predict the leading professions in the coming years C describe the effect of unemployment on society D suggest a better term for future retirement According to Professor Handy the future workforce will A adapt to the changes in retirement easily B be mainly self employed C have fewer full time workers than today D work on a contract basis From the last paragraph we learn that about years from now A the number of retirees will double in many countries B ageing will be a common and serious problem C of the population will live to be years old D the third age will be the most important part of our lives My grandfather died more than twenty five years ago I was fifteen He was kind strong fair and very funny When I was a young musician he was my biggest fan I played my violin for him when he visited and he loved everything but each time he had one request Could you play Amazing Grace he asked full of hope and with a twinkle in his eye because he knew my answer was always I don t know that one We went through this routine at every major holiday and I always figured I d have time to learn it for him later About the time I entered high school and started guitar Grandpa got cancer The last time I saw him alive was Thanksgiving weekend in My mom warned us that Grandpa didn t look the same anymore and that we should prepare ourselves For a moment I didn t recognize him He looked so small among all the white sheets We had all gathered in Ohio for the holiday and I m sure we all knew we were there to say good bye I can see now that Grandpa held on long enough to see us each one more time I remember how we ate in the dining room and laughed and talked while Grandpa rested in his hospital bed I wonder if it was sad for him to be alone with our voices and laughter Knowing Grandpa he was probably content The next morning I found my moment alone with him I pulled out my guitar tuned to his appreciative gaze and finally played for him Amazing Grace I had worked on it for weeks knowing it never mattered whether I actually played it well and choosing not to believe as I played that it was my last concert for my biggest fan The cancer had stolen his smile but I saw joy in his eyes He held my hand afterward and I knew I had done something important I argued with people all through college about my music major I was told by strangers that music wouldn t make me any money and it wasn t useful like being a doctor But I know firsthand that with music I was able to give my grandpa something at a point when no

colored wires hanging from their ears wherever they go They move about in their personal bubbles sometimes unaware of what s happening around them Outside life is shut out So are you one of them For me walking around in my own personal bubble is perfect What s even better wearing earphones seems to give a signal to people which says I m not available for chatting at the moment Suppose you re at work and about to make an incredible breakthrough but a colleague suddenly turns up At this precise moment the slightest disturbance would break your concentration Once again those wires hanging from your ears would be sure to give that Go away signal It s probably part of the growing up stage when they just want to ignore their whole family While their mothers give them lectures about why they should do their homework they can just turn up the volume on their MP player smile and say Yes Mum Problem solved Pretty soon not only will we have pretty colored wires hanging from our ears but also our brains will be directly plugged into some new high tech instrument We ll be in a virtual world communicating with everyone else or choosing not to as we like In this world we will all be

one got absolutely a unfair what that As is vividly shown in the picture a country boy is crying helplessly in the darkness longing eagerly for school education It implies severe educational problems in some rural areas of China In contrast the city boy on the right is enjoying all the benefits The comparison indicates the educational inequality in modern China In the countryside school age children are often dropping out of school due to poverty Even those who manage to stay in school are still suffering from the low standards of educational facilities and academic qualities Comparatively city children have much better opportunities to receive good education Thus schools in the countryside generally have much lower enrollment rates than those in the city which in turn worsens the problem of educational inequality To solve this problem the government should spend more money on the improvement of education in rural areas Meanwhile the media can appeal for public donations for rural education Moreover all the people in the community should be aware of the seriousness of the problem and do whatever to help Only if we do these can we have more social justice and

week old and my tree stood in the corner of our room with its collection of memories proudly in a shower of colorful lights I d long enough I got up went to the and dragged the boxes into the room The garland was the first to I took the large ornaments off next They a large pile on our bed An hour later our bed was covered with Christmas memories I prepared the boxes and placed ornaments in their protective packaging pausing every few minutes to a favorite Hey little Santa I held the Santa from my childhood Thanks for being my friend for almost fifty years He was a little but still gives me a flood of wonderful memories There was a collection of handmade ones my children made in their first years of school more than twenty years ago They are perfect in design but every year they go on my memory tree A few hours after I started the boxes were back in the garage the room was and I sat staring at the corner It took me two days of work to my tree but only a few hours to take it apart My tree is a good marriage or a great friendship the tree they take a long time to decorate with memories but can be torn down What once stood proudly in the glow of love comes tumbling down and all it is an unkind word or a thoughtless act Every year I have to put my tree away but not my marriage or friendships They get to glow in the corner of my life for I live I get to analyze my tree and find memories for a few weeks every year I can do the same with the loves in my life every day When I held the Santa a flood of wonderful memories The same happens when I hold my wife or see the smile of a

and write is a complex process which can be disrupted in various ways leading to disorders known as dyslexia and dysgraphia Two new studies published in a recent special issue of Elsevier s Cortex provide evidence of this variety suggesting that effective treatment needs to take it into account A group of researchers from the Universities of Bari and Rome in Italy studied the reading and writing abilities of Italian dyslexic children comparing their performance with that of children with normal reading ability Italian is an orthographically transparent language meaning that letters tend to correspond to the same sounds whereas many letters in the English alphabet change their sound from word to word like the c in car and city However the new study showed that even in Italian in which it is relatively straightforward to convert sounds into letters children still have difficulty in spelling Younger children with dyslexia generally performed worse than proficient readers however the older ones showed a more selective impairment when spelling words suggesting that knowledge of vocabulary may be more important in spelling than previously thought The other study from Tel Aviv University Israel provided the first systematic description of a type of reading disorder called attentional dyslexia in which children identify letters correctly but the letters jump between words on the page e g kind wing is read as wind king Teachers and neuron psychologists often notice that children substitute letters when reading but in this type of dyslexia the substitutions are not caused by inability to identify letters or convert them into sounds they result from migrations of letters between words The findings showed that letters would mostly migrate to the same position in another word so the first letter of one word would switch places with the first letter of another word Awareness to the existence of this type of dyslexia is important because it suggests a straightforward way to assist these children in reading by presenting a single word at a time e g with the help of a word sized window cut in a piece of cardboard We know from the first new study that A Italian is easier to learn in comparison with English B knowledge of vocabulary has a close link with spelling C in Italian each letter has only one correspondent sound D children with normal reading ability have no trouble in converting letters into sounds As is inferred from the passage A many people cannot distinguish learning to read and learning to write B converting letters into sounds is more difficult than the other way round C younger children usually have a poorer knowledge of vocabulary D in the past not enough attention is paid to knowledge of vocabulary In attentional dyslexia children A do not pay enough attention to the meaning of each word B are not capable of telling letters apart C can not change letters into sounds accordingly D tend to transfer the first letter from one word to another C Marc had worked in the city hall s engineering department for so long that the city was laid out in his mind like a map full of names and places And then something happened that filled him with shock One August afternoon he discovered a card saying GREEN BOTTLE STREET at the back of the drawer He checked the listed details It was not there It was a lost a forgotten street which existed in the heart of Montreal not half a mile from city hall and no one had known He put the card in his pocket and the next day he went looking for the street with beating heart At his first glance Marc realized how it had gotten its unusual name It was exactly like a bottle in shape With the sun shining on the garden plots and the blue sky overhead the street gave him a sense of peace A woman some sixty years of age was watering roses in the garden of the first house to his right He announced I m from the city engineering department madam The woman recovered herself and set her watering can down So you have found out at last she said We paid our taxes and made out a lot of forms and answered the questions of various officials Then after a while we were sent no notices so we paid no more taxes No one bothered us at all It was a long time before we understood that in some way they d forgotten about us Marc nodded Of course if Green Bottle Street had been ignored by the city hall no inspectors would go there no tax collectors All would pass merrily by For several years the tenants here had lived in harmony with each other and the landlord The owner became so attached to them that he gave them all he had when he died I have lived here for more than twenty years I hope to end my days here as well She smiled pleasantly at him apparently forgetting for the moment that he carried in his pocket a bomb that could blow their little world to pieces You remind me of my nephew she said suddenly He was a dear boy I was heart broken when he died I m the last of my family you know Marc thought of his noisy and violent landlady and neighbors He could not recall when he had been spoken to with such simple goodwill His heart warmed to this old lady I wonder he said slowly I am a good tenant and I wonder Oh yes she leaned forward eagerly you could have the top floor of my house I m sure it would suit you Marc took the card out of his pocket and tore it across and dropped the pieces in the watering can As far as he was concerned Green Bottle Street would remain mislaid forever The underlined sentence So you ve found out at last shows that the woman was A disappointed B puzzled C curious D excited It can be inferred that Marc A carried a bomb in his pocket B hated inspectors and tax collectors C looked for the long lost street happily D would probably move to Green Bottle Street Marc tore the card into pieces mainly because A he fell in love with the woman B Green Bottle Street got mislaid C it presented the wrong information D he treasured the peace in Green Bottle Street From the passage we may know that A the woman s nephew resembled Marc a lot B the woman was attached to where she lived C tenants in Green Bottle Street often had conflicts D Marc s landlord gave away what he had when he died D The word tolerance is widely used in liberal democracies It indicates a positive meaning Politicians urge us to be tolerant towards minorities Educators teach us to be tolerant towards the other The press is full of references to the need to display tolerance when faced with individuals or groups espousing a different view or holding a different religious belief A tolerant society is an objective sought after by anyone who believes in the values of democracy A tolerant individual is attributed with virtuous qualities The question we must ask is whether we have been using the word tolerance fully aware of its meaning and whether we have applied it correctly to reflect what we really wish to convey The word tolerance means to bear or to bear with If I tolerate something or someone I basically say that I am ready to bear it or him I can tolerate a bad smell or a noisy neighbour The act of toleration forces me to desist from conveying my objection to the existence of a phenomenon which I find difficult to bear A bad smell or a noisy neighbour is considered by me to be an objectionable phenomenon By tolerating either of them I am not transforming the bad smell or the noisy neighbour into positive phenomena Let s be honest I don t have a different taste when it comes to bad smells I simply dislike it and wish that it disappears I don t respect the noisy neighbour I would rather have him stop at once the noise he is making so I can live in peace To try to remove the bad smell or take reasonable action in order for the noisy neighbour to stop bothering me would most probably not be considered an intolerant act by most people Now let s try to apply the word tolerance in reference to a person who is law abiding and holds a legally acceptable different view from my own I may have a strong view which is opposed to his Quite frankly I may decide to tolerate his view By so doing I would be attributing to it a negative characteristic I would apply the same attitude to his view as to the bad smell or noisy neighbour Thus to try to take action in order to make his view disappear would be considered an intolerant act To tolerate his view the way I would a bad smell or a noisy neighbour could hardly be considered virtuous The subject tolerating is by nature not equal to the object being tolerated If I tolerate you I essentially say that I am above you and am prepared although unwillingly to bear with your presence or with your practices or opinions That may be true in the case of an individual who is ready to tolerate the other However this attitude by such an individual though empirically true is hardly a virtue Certainly the fact that an individual in reality may merely tolerate the other or his opinion does not justify a government or any official authority promoting tolerance as a virtue One cannot tolerate an equal being True equality involves respect not toleration To respect the other as a distinctive person is hardly to tolerate him This is the true meaning of equality diversity existing in a mutually respectful socio legal setting The danger with tolerance is that it can lead to the acceptance of individuals or groups bent on destroying the foundations of democratic systems We have seen such cases with regard to political parties or destructive religious groups that have been treated in a liberal manner under the guise of tolerance A tolerant attitude involves the grant of a favour not a right The question we should ask ourselves is whether we would ever wish a parliament to make laws according to us as individuals and as part of a collective entity or a permission to pursue certain actions interpreted as a favour rather than a right Indeed would we ever wish anyone to listen to our views and accept us the way we are simply because he is kind enough to tolerate us The first two paragraphs are mainly intended to show that A tolerance is a symbol of liberal democracies B democratic society always advocates tolerance C people s understanding of tolerance is one sided D tolerance can be applied to many situations The underlined part desist from in Paragraph can be replaced by A deny B dislike C stop D keep The example of a bad smell and a noisy neighbour is raised to indicate that A the writer are fed up with them B most people find them hard to tolerate C the writer isn t prejudiced against them D tolerating them isn t a virtuous act The main idea of Paragraph is that A tolerance has nothing to do with respect B most people promote tolerance as a virtue C people should show respect for each other D tolerance shows an unequal relationship Which of the following will the writer probably agree with A Too much tolerance will endanger the foundations of democratic systems B By tolerating people can transform something negative into the opposite C People tolerating others are likely to consider them as their equals D Being tolerant should be regarded as a right instead of a favour The best title for this passage should be A Tolerance and respect B What is to be tolerated C Is Tolerance a Virtue D Should people be tolerant II Chronic disorganization occurs when one has a habit of being disorganized over a long period which means the person is constantly unsystematic in how he conducts life and business One suffering from this problem may find relief in the fact that it isn t actually a disease or even an official disorder It s the continued lack of organization in one s life Someone may become addicted to collecting a certain thing yet never organize the collection as it grows out of control This can especially be a problem for those with a lot of time and money at hand yet the problem can be serious for any type of person in a wide variety of situation One s personal attitude can often be a big part of why the chronic disorganization exists Once the attitude of acceptance about being a slob is in someone s head it s hard to remove If someone tells himself that he is a slob he will likely live up to that self image created by him or by those around him One first receives true awareness of the disorder of chronic disorganization when it starts to negatively affect relationships with friends and family members Everybody becomes affected by this situation especially those sharing living places with the one involved The National Study Group for Chronic Disorganization HSGCD recommends that one get help through a professional organizer The study found that all of the subjects in the study had problems with making decisions There were varied reasons given for this problem of decision making Among them were fears and prioritizing issues Research is ongoing for the link between problems in decision making and chronic disorganization Chronic disorganization often begins with situational disorganization something most people experience at some point Someone who has lost someone significant to him may start to be troubled by disorganization after a divorce Someone who experienced changes in life and in his career is likely to let things like organization and order fall by the wayside However one doesn t instantly have chronic disorganization If you re going through hell keep going That s an old saying that s true about one s struggles with chronic disorganization Every person has the power to change within himself It s a matter of staying organized one day at a time Those who have left chronic disorganization in the past have often done so by promising to stay organized simply for that single day Definition It means that the person is disorganized in life and business over a long period of organization one is likely to have the problem Recognizing the problem One example is that an addict is to organize the collection The existence of chronic disorganization is partly by one s personal attitude One doesn t the disorder of chronic disorganization until it has bad effects on the relationships with friends and family members The findings of the study All subjects in the study from the problem of poor decision making which is linked with chronic disorganization Further research are still in Warning People losing someone significant going through a divorce or changes in one s life and career have a to ignore organization and order Good news In with chronic disorganization every person has the power to change at least one single day at a time I ABBCA BACBC CBAAC CBACA BCBCC CBCBC BCDBD CBCDA BADAB CBCBA DBBCC BD BCD

really a problem you just push your arms out and the doors move back However this couple appeared to be unfamiliar with the underground and this man did the worst thing possible he stepped back but somehow leaned forward This meant that the doors closed on his neck so his head was inside the train and the rest of his body was outside He had a most peculiar expression on his face and he was waving his arms up and down His wife who had found a seat didn t seem to be the least disturbed I realized that there was a real danger that he might be dragged along the platform and seriously injured so I leapt from my seat and along with two other men pulled at the doors which soon sprang back Nobody else did anything apart from one person who said Pull the communication button but remained seated The man took his seat next to his wife They were both completely calm and didn t say a word I II I A B C What is the woman doing A Singing a song B Listening to music C Reading a book

Changshu after he succeeded in taking the revenge C Even when you re extremely busy you aren t using your time with efficiency There are gaps in everyone s schedule where they aren t doing anything important Even if your schedule has no gaps there is probably lots of time where you aren t working as fast or as effectively as you possibly could Why aren t you completely efficient It s because time isn t the limiting factor If it were the limiting factor people could work non stop without breaks or any unproductive distractions Instead people even those who are highly productive need to take breaks occasionally procrastinate and slow down on tasks throughout the day The real and most important limiting factor for productivity is your energy levels to pay attention Energy levels limit your productivity because when you re tired you can have ample time and still not get everything done Your attention ability is also limited because even if there are a million things that need to be done you can only focus on one or two at a time You might not be able to insert another hours into your schedule without making some sacrifices But even extremely busy people can add an hour or two into their schedule without cancelling anything The reason it s hard to find time isn t a lack of time It s because you don t have enough energy left to focus on something else that needs to fit into your day I first suspected time wasn t the real problem during an extremely busy period in my life over a year ago I was insanely busy but at that time I still exercised regularly I had daily to do lists with over twenty items and I still found time to exercise However after a few weeks off due to illness stopped exercising I was not busy by any standards in fact my schedule was incredibly light Despite this free time I found it hard to find time to exercise It seemed to get pushed later and later into my schedule until it was gone How can I explain this odd experience I believe you have known it If someone can t work with efficiency the most important limiting factor is A a schedule without gaps B breaks and distractions C the limited time D the limited energy According to paragraph everyone including the extremely busy people can A work without any rest B focus on many things at a time C find some more time in a day D do some exercise regularly After a few weeks off what was the change of the writer s life A He had a longer daily to do lists with over twenty items B He stopped doing exercise because of the lack of energy C He found it hard to find time to exercise because he was busier D He pushed most of the things later and later in his schedule The writer gives the example of himself in the last paragraph in order to A prove what the real limiting factor is B show us how busily he needs to work C explain how important a healthy body is D tell us what an odd experience he has D A Dutch artist and designer has come up with a device which he hopes will get rid of pollutants from Beijing s smog skies creating clean air for the city s mask wearing people An electromagnetic field will pull particles in the smog to the ground where they can be easily cleaned It s like when you have a balloon which has static and your hair goes toward it Same with the smog says artist Daan Roosegaarde His studio has reached an agreement with the Beijing government to test the technology in one of tile capital s parks With its skies regularly covered by dirty gray smog Beijing this week announced a series of emergency measures to handle the problem Roosegaarde says an indoor model device has already proven it works and is confident that the results with the help of a team of scientists and engineers can be replicated outside Beijing is quite a good place because the smog in Beijing is quite low It lies in a valley so there s not so much wind It s a good environment to explore this kind of thing We ll be able to purify the air and the challenge is to get the top of the smog so you can see the sun again Roosegaarde acknowledges that projects like this are a way of drawing attention to the problem rather than a practical solution to Beijing s awful air pollution This is not the real answer for smog The real answer has to do with clean cars different industry and different lifestyles However he hopes the project will make a fundamental statement by allowing the city s people to realize the difference between breathing clean and smog filled air The device works by A helping keep the particles out with more masks B pulling pollutants to the ground

technology in Beijing B they have proven the results of the device both indoors and outdoors C the results of the air cleaning device can be expectable D the Beijing government has never done anything to handle the air pollution What does Roosegaarde really mean by saying Beijing is quite a good place A The air pollution in Beijing is not quite serious B The weather in Beijing is good for foreigners to live in C Beijing is quite fit for using the air cleaning device D It is easy to get the top of the smog in Beijing Roosegaarde appeals to people in Beijing to A pay attention to air pollution and solve the problem finally B invent more devices to clean the smog in Beijing C drive modern cars and try different lifestyles D realize how serious the pollution they re facing is E AB F

the particular character or aggregate total of qualities that distinguishes one person or thing from others Many artists late in the last century were in search of a means to express their individuality Modern dance was one of the ways some of these people sought to free their creative spirit At the beginning there was no exacting technique no foundation from which to build In later years trial error and genius founded the techniques and the principles of the movement Eventually innovators even drew from what they considered the dread ballet but first they had to get rid of all that was academic so that the new could be discovered The beginnings of modern dance were happening before Isadora Duncan but she was the first person to bring the new dance to general audiences and see it accepted and acclaimed Her search for a natural movement form sent her to nature She believed movement should be as natural as the swaying of the trees and the rolling waves of the sea and should be in harmony with the movements of the Earth Her great contributions are in three areas First she began the expansion of the kinds of movement that could be used in dance Before Duncan danced ballet was the only type of dance performed in concert In the ballet the feet and legs were emphasized with virtuosity shown by complex codified positions and movements Duncan performed dance by using her body in the freest possible way Her dance stemmed from her soul and spirit She was one of the pioneers who broke tradition so others might be able to develop the art Her second contribution lies in dance costume She rejected ballet shoes and stiff costumes These were replaced with flowing Grecian tunes bare feet and unbound hair She believed in the natural body being allowed to move freely and her dress displayed this ideal Her third contribution was in the use of music In her performances she used the symphonies of great masters including Beethoven and Wagner which was not the usual custom She was as exciting and eccentric in her personal life as in her dance According to the passage what did nature represent to Isadora Duncan A Something to conquer B A model for movement C A place to find peace D A symbol of disorder Compared to those of the ballet Isadora Duncan s costumes were less A costly B colorful C graceful D restrictive We can infer from the passage that the author A appreciates modern dance very much B dislikes Isadora Duncan s dance C thinks highly of individuality D knows a lot about modern arts Which of the following would be the best title for the passage A Artists of the Last Century B Evolution of Dance in the th Century C Natural Movement in Dance D A Pioneer in Modern Dance C Since Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay climbed Mount Everest Mount Qomolangma s peak is no longer a lonely place and is turning into a trash heap So far more than climbers have successfully reached the peak And they have complained about waiting for hours in the bottlenecks on the way to the peak a situation that isn t just uncomfortable it s cold and windy up there but downright dangerous If bad weather strikes climbers can and do die As a matter of fact the dangerous crowds aren t the only problem on Qomolangma All those climbers need to bring a lot of gear and much of them ends up being left on the mountain sometimes even the peak itself Mount Qomolangma is becoming the world s largest dump Here s mountaineer Mark Jenkins writing in National Geographic about the state of Qomolangma The two standard routes the Northeast Ridge and the Southeast Ridge are disgustingly polluted with oxygen cans and torn tents everywhere But the good news is that some mountaineers are taking it upon themselves to clean up Qomolangma Mountianeer Paul Thelen and his friend Eberhard Schaaf are part of the annual Eco Everest Expedition which has been cleaning up rubbish from base camps to the peak since So far they ve collected over tons of garbage Some of that rubbish is even being used for a higher purpose As part of the Mount Everest Art Project a group of artists from Nepal collected tons of garbage brought down the mountain by climbers They ve transformed the cans and oxygen tanks and in one case part of the remains of a helicopter into pieces of art that have already gone on exhibition in Nepal s capital Part of the profit from sales will go to the Everest Peakers Association which has helped collect tons of rubbish on the slopes of the mountain What do we learn about the bottlenecks on the way to Mount Qomolangma s peak A They are relatively safe B They are often crowded C They are very easy to pass D They are sites of base camps What does the underlined word gear mean A Equipment for climbing mountains B The food climbers brought onto the mountain C Some important machines used for the bottlenecks D Some rubbish found on the mountain The group of Nepali artists A created works of art using rubbish from Qomolangma B were employed by the Everest Peakeers Association C climbed Qomolangma and collected tons of trash D painted beautiful pictures of Mount Qomolangma s peak What can be the best title for the text A Eco Everest Expedition Proves Successful B Qomolangma Has Become A Huge Mess C Test Yourself Against Qomolangma D Recycle Rubbish On Qomolangma D Students from Florida International University in Miami walked on water Thursday for a class assignment To do it they wore aquatic shoes they designed and created Alex Quinones was the first to make it to the other side of a foot lake on campus in record time just over a minute Quinones who wore oversized boat like shoes also won last year and will receive Students had to wear the aquatic shoes and make it across the lake in order to earn an A on the assignment for Architecture Professor Jaime Canaves Materials and Methods Construction Class It s traditional in a school of architecture to do boats out of cardboard for a boat race I thought our students were a little bit more special than that Canaves said We decided to do the walk on water event to take it to the next level A total of students competed in the race this year in teams Only teams failed to cross the lake Others who fell got back up and made it to the end The race is open to all students and anyone in the community The youngest person to ever participate was a year old girl who competed in place of her mother while the oldest was a year old female A large crowd on campus joined Canaves as he cheered on the racers He shouted encouraging words but also laughed as some unsteadily made their way to the end A part of this is for them to have more understanding of designing and make it work better he said It is also a lesson in life for the students Anything including walking on water is possible if you do the research test it and go through the design process seriously For what purpose did the students take part in the race A To go across the lake to school B To

involved in student activities C The student who made it to the end in the race would succeed in their professional career D Professor Canaves attaches importance to hands on learning experience The purpose of the passage is to A show his approval of the unique teaching style B report an interesting assignment C inspire teachers to be more creative D encourage more people to take part in the race Of the many unpleasant emotions we can experience fear may top the list Fear can also keep us from pursuing the things in life that really matter like following our dreams and developing important relationships I have some ideas though of how to be free from fear Experience fear I used to be very afraid of speaking in front of people I would get sweaty palms and my stomach would be so tied up that I wouldn t be able to eat However each time I spoke I noticed afterwards that it wasn t that bad Things I fear are never as bad in reality as I make them out in my mind Create space The first and most important step to being fearless is to create some space between ourselves and the emotion of fear This isn t accomplished by ignoring the fear or trying to talk ourselves out of it In fact a recent research shows that by simply admitting the emotion we actually begin to reverse the fight or flight response in the body Control the breath and feel the fear Once we acknowledge the presence of fear the second step is to control the breathing so that it becomes slower and gentler We try to make the breath just a little bit longer and feel how fear manifests in the body With practice we can create enough space between us and the emotion of fear so that we re able to replace a fearful thought with a positive one For instance before I get up to speak in front of a group of people I imagine that the audience is positively impressed by what I say and that I manage to complete the speech successfully A Space is created only when we can honestly acknowledge that fear exists B We can imagine a positive outcome for whatever we re about to do C Fear if left uncontrolled can even destroy our life D So one way to get rid of fear is to simply push ourselves to do things that we fear E When we can see a positive outcome in our mind fear no longer holds us back F But fear is more than just physically unpleasant G As we pay attention to the physical symptoms of fear we can see fear

right II It is recommended that one of the effective ways to make your English writing skills improved should be keeping a diary compare with other form of writing it takes little time as well as being shorter It is general recognized that you will get to learn how to express yourself in English if you insist on practising Apparently you may meet with good many difficulties at times The trouble is you can not find appropriate words and phrases to give expression to your mind In addition there are lots of idiomatic ways of Chinese appearing in your diary my point of view a piece of good advice is that there should be no way more suitable than keeping a notebook and an English dictionary within easy reach Whenever something beat you put down and then consult the dictionary Certainly you can get help from your English teacher if necessary I m sure it is of great use to keep a diary in English for the improve of writing abilities What I am actually eager to do is being a

England million children travel to school every day It is reported that only a small number of pupils cycle to school under although one in three children would actually like to Experts say that to stay healthy children need at least one hour of moderate exercise every day But only six out of ten boys and four out of ten girls get that One of the reasons is that parents have developed a habit of driving their children to school when they could just walk or ride a bike to school Teachers often say that children who walk or ride a bike to school are more ready to listen to their classes ask and answer questions in class than those driven by car and the school journey is a good chance for children to learn about road safety and other life skills Also for many children riding a bike is more fun than going to school by car Most parents know the benefits Then what s stopping them from letting their kids ride a bike Safety is the number one worry for them But actually riding a bike is not as dangerous as parents think it is When you decide to buy a bike you should be aware that a bike that is too big or too small is dangerous Don t try to get a bike that your child will grow into Get the right size in good working order Generally inch wheels are on bikes for year olds inch wheels are for year olds inch wheels are suitable for those over and some older children should even take bikes with inch wheels but the main thing is that the bike fits your child This passage is mainly written for A parents who send and receive their children to school B children who have asked their

completely occupied doing something constructive I met this woman and her husband in the dining car while l was traveling from New York to my farm in Missouri This couple told me that their son had joined the armed forces the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor The woman told me that she had almost ruined her health worrying over that only son Where was he Was he safe Would he be wounded Killed When I asked her how she overcame her worry she replied I got busy She told me that at first she had dismissed her maid and tried to keep busy by doing all her housework herself But that didn t help much The trouble was she said that I could do my housework almost mechanically So I kept on worrying Then I realized I needed some new kind of work that would keep me busy both mentally and physically So I took a job as a saleswoman in a store That did it she said I immediately found myself involved in a lot of activities customers crowding around me asking for prices sizes colors Never a second to think of anything except my immediate duty And when night came I could think of nothing except getting off my aching feet As soon as I ate dinner I fell into bed and instantly became unconscious I had neither the time nor the energy to worry Doing housework failed to work on the woman because A there wasn t much housework to do B she didn t like doing housework at all C she didn t need to use her mind to do housework D it was too boring to do housework Why did the woman take a job as a saleswoman A She had to work to support her family B She enjoyed being surrounded by people C She wanted to

economy began to decline some years ago the downs seemed to outnumber the ups Albany was changing completely We had to find a way to reinvent ourselves says Wendy Kirbey the former owner of a coffee shop downtown So in Kirbey proposed a project she hoped would help her town rediscover its pride a Victorian style carousel the animals carved by the townspeople themselves It felt like the perfect fit for our historical town she says Despite a sceptical city council and a starting budget of only Kfrbey and a handful of volunteers got to work Ten years later more than people have spent nearly hours on the Albany Carousel making a lively herd of unusual creatures Each of the animals has been adopted by a sponsor who oversees its creation and often adds a personal touch The project has shown the diverse skills and creative talents of Albany pop The amazing thing about this attempt is that whenever we ve needed something it s been provided for us says Kirbey Somebody s aunt knows somebody s uncle who comes down to lend a hand Kirbey says it will take two more years to complete the project But the carousel is already working its magic It is our town s No attraction says Rod Porsche of the Albany Visitors Association As the animals are completed they re put on show in local hotels restaurants and shops people who come to see the fantastical figures around town and tour the workshop

see each kind Then we ll send out a report to a scientific organization that is collecting about birds from people all over the country Dad pulled into the parking lot of the state park Then with flashing in hand they began their hike into the woods Annie zipped up her coat and tried to keep from trembling She had not expected the morning to be so cold Luckily her gloves were in her pocket Suddenly Annie s father stopped and gestured for her to be still Obeying Annie did not take another step She thought she heard a low crying up head That s certainly a screech owl her father whispered Let s get a look at it After looking more closely Annie could see that it was a small owl Sensing danger the owl narrowed its eyes and pulled its feathers tightly against its body Annie carefully wrote down in her notebook that they had seen a screech owl Walking a little farther they came to a tall oak tree This looks like a perfect spot to attract owls Dad said I m going to play a recording of common call of the barred owl Maybe we can get one to answer Annie could hardly believe her ear The recorded call sounded as if the bird were asking Who cooks for you Moments later Annie thought she heard a return call in the distance She held her breath and waited Suddenly a huge bird landed very quietly on a branch above them Annie had long forgotten how cold it was She stood in wonder shining her flashlight on the bird and studying it carefully The barred owl was nearly two feet tall Grey feathers surrounded its dark eyes The bird did not stay long but it did not matter Annie would never forget the image of the powerful barred owl Why did Annie and her father go to the state park A To take a hike in the woods B To record the call of barred owl C To collect information about birds D To protect the environment for wildlife In paragraph why did Annie s father stop her suddenly A He noticed a screech owl B He heard somebody crying C He sensed they were in danger D He reminded her to take down note How did Annie feel when she saw the barred owl A Bored B Amazed C Frightened D Relaxed C I told my friend Graham that I often cycle two miles from my house to the town centre but unfortunately there is a big hill on the route He replied You mean fortunately He explained that I should be glad of the extra exercise that the hill provided My attitude to the hill has now changed I used to complain as I approached it but now I tell myself the following This hill will exercise my heart and lungs It will help me to lose weight and get fit It will mean that I live longer This hill is my friend Finally I comfort myself with the thought of all those silly people who pay money to go to a gym and sit on stationery exercise bicycles when I can get the same value for free I have a smile of satisfaction as I reach the top of the hill Problems are there to be faced and overcome We cannot achieve anything with an easy life Helen Keller was the first deaf and blind person to gain a university degree Her activism and writing proved inspirational She wrote Character cannot be developed in ease Only through experiences of suffering can the soul be strengthened vision cleared ambition inspired and success achieved One of the main determinants of success in life is our attitude towards adversity From time to time we all face hardships problems accidents and difficulties Some are of our making but many are no fault of our own While we cannot choose the adversity we can choose our attitude towards it Douglas Bader was when in he had both legs cut off following a flying accident He was determined to fly again and went on to become one of the leading flying aviators in the Battle of Britain with aerial victories over the Germans He was an inspiration to others during the war He said Don t listen to anyone who tells you that you can t do this or that That s nonsense Make up your mind you ll never use crutches or a stick and then have a go at everything Go to school and join in all the games you can Go anywhere you want to But never never let them persuade you that things are too difficult or impossible The biographies of great people are full of examples of how they took steps to overcome the difficulties they faced The common thread is that they did not become depressed They chose their attitude They chose to be positive They took on the challenge They won Nevertheless there is still the problem of how you change your attitude towards adversity Which of the following is true according to the author of the passage A Going to a gym is greatly beneficial to people s health B Climbing hills on bicycles is the best way to take exercise C Those who want to achieve success can t expect to live an easy life D People s attitude to adversity is the only factor of their success By quoting what Douglas Bader said the author intends to tell us A Failure is the mother of success B A bad workman quarrels with his tools C If you risk nothing you will have nothing D Nothing is difficult to the man who will try Following this passage the author will further talk about A how his friend helped him to change his attitude towards the adversity he faced B what steps to take to change your attitude towards the adversity you face C why it is important to keep optimistic in face of adversity D what great people have in common Which of the following can best function as the title of the passage A Face adversity with a smile B Different attitudes towards adversity C Nothing is impossible D Life is full of adversity D Adding math talk to story time at home is a winning factor for children s math achievement according to a new research from the University of Chicago The study from psychologists Sian Beilock and Susan Levine shows a marked increase in math achievement among children whose families used Bedtime Math an iPad app that delivers engaging math story problems for parents and children to solve together Even children who used the app with their parents as little as once a week saw gains in math achievement by the end of the school year The app s effect was especially strong for children whose parents tend to be anxious or uncomfortable with math Previous research from this group has demonstrated the importance of adults attitudes about math for children s math success For example a recent study found that math anxious parents who help their children with math homework actually weaken their children s math achievement The new findings demonstrate that structured positive interactions around math at home can cut the link between parents uneasiness about math and children s low math achievement Many Americans experience high levels of anxiety when they have to solve a math problem with a majority of adults feeling at least some worries about math said Beilock professor in Psychology and author of Choke a book about stress and performance These math anxious parents are probably less likely to talk about math at home which affects how competent their children are in math Bedtime Math encourages a dialogue between parents and kids about math and offers a way to engage in high quality math interactions in a low effort high impact way Study participants included first grade students and their parents Families were given an iPad installed with a version of the Bedtime Math app with which parents and their children read stories and answer questions involving math including topics like counting shapes and problem solving A control group received a reading app that had similar stories without the math content and questions related to reading comprehension instead Children s math achievement was assessed at the beginning and end of the school year Parents completed a questionnaire about their nervousness with math The more times parents and children in the math group used the app the higher children s achievement on a math assessment at the end of the school year Indeed children who frequently used the math app with their parents outperformed similar students in the reading group by almost three months in math achievement at year s end Bedtime Math is an iPad app that A requires parents and children to answer reading comprehension questions B assesses children s math achievement and parents nervousness with math C teaches children how to count recognize shapes and solve practical problems D encourages children together with their parents to solve math story problems The previous study found that A help from math anxious parents improves children s math achievement B children s math achievement is related to parents attitude about math C interactions around math at home will cut off the family relationship D children can achieve more success if they see the importance of math We can infer from the passage that A children using the app for three months can see gains in math achievement B children whose parents are uneasy about math outperform other students C it is the math problems related to the stories that make the great difference D the frequency of using the app has nothing to do with children s achievement Which is the best title for the passage A High quality math interactions improve performance B Frequent use of app can develop problem solving ability C Low effort activities create good parent child relationship D High anxiety parents influence children s attitude about math I m years old and there are several things that life has taught me that I want to share with you Here are the lessons that life has taught me in the past years Take care of your body Life is unfairly biased towards people who look good like it or not So it s important that you do all that is in your power to look your best You

is to save at least twenty percent of your income If you are to be wealthy you must not just earn a lot you must save a lot Think in the long term In high school I was thinking about college in college I was thinking about life after college I m designing my life and I m making decisions today that will enable me to live the life I desire when I m in my s s and s You have to think in the long term you have to see the big picture Realize the power of focus Focus focus focus If you fail in this lifetime you will fail because of broken focus If you focus on the goals that are most important to you you will achieve them The problem is that there are so many distractions Winners decide to major on majors and they even let important things slip because they just focus on achieving what is critical to their goals A The importance of saving B If you plan your future properly you will live into your plans C Save your money D Nothing is more important than focus E What separates the winners from the losers is that the winners learn to focus on their goals F I mean dressing nicely working out and eating right G It s important that you pursue relationships with individuals who are good first A B C D A gentle breeze blew through Jennifer s hair The golden red sun was She was on the beach looking up at the fiery ball She was by its color deep red in the middle softly fading

public health But she has some worries Public service doesn t pay much and her study at Miami University costs about a year with living expenses Ella has a scholarship from Miami University that covers just a year and has taken out loans to pay for the rest She would spend years paying back her student loans and not have money left over The good news is that in Congress recognized that there were so many students in Ella s position that it passed the College Cost Reduction Act There were two programs established by this act that Ella could look into The first is the income based repayment plan which allows lower income graduates with a lot of debt to reduce their monthly payments Depending on a graduate s income and level of debt the program could limit her annual educational loan debt repayment to percent of real income said Peter William vice chairman of the College Saving Foundation The second is the public service loan forgiveness plan in which the federal government will forgive the remaining debt of borrowers who make year loan payment while working full time in public service jobs But the graduate must have a certain loan which is listed in the plan Typically it is projected that a borrower who performs public service under this program will repay only about one fourth to one half as much money as a borrower who does not William said He also pointed out that public service is broadly defined and includes any government and nonprofit organization job What might Ella Wood be concerned most when she graduates next year A She might not a master s degree directly B She might not find a job in public health easily C She had to pay back her scholarship to Miami University D She wondered how to ease the pain of being in debt for years How can Ella benefit from the first program mentioned in the passage A The income tax will be cut down B One four of debt will be forgiven C The total amount of debt will be reduced D Ella will have more time to pay back the debt We can learn from the passage that A every graduate will get a scholarship like Ella B graduates who work in public service get the highest payment C the federal government encourages graduates to work in public service D the College Cost Reduction Act only helps graduates with master s degree What s the main idea of the passage A The total expense in American universities is too high B The US government is trying to relieve graduates from heavy debt C There are a lot of different programs to help students pay their tuition D The US government forces all students to choose public service jobs B Facebook and Twitter have become a significant threat to marriage with social media now a factor in an increasing number of divorce cases say lawyers One in seven married individuals have considered divorce because of their spouse s postings of Facebook or other online sites according to research A similar percentage admit that they search online for evidence of their spouse s disloyalty while nearly one in five say they have daily quarrels because of the way their husband or wife uses social media The research was assigned by law firm Gordon in response to an increase in the number of its clients who said that Facebook Skype Snapchat Twitter or other social media sites had played a part in their divorce Andrew Newbury of law firm Gordon said Social media is the new marriage Five years ago Facebook was rarely mentioned in the context of a marriage ending but now it has become common Social media specific pictures and posts on Facebook are now being routinely raised in divorces The survey by Censuswide among husbands and wives found the most common reasons for checking their spouse s social media accounts were to discover who they were talking to who they were meeting and where they were going A quarter of the married people said the resulting suspicions led to quarrels at least once a week and percent said such quarrels were daily events Arguments were caused by contact with former partners by the sending of secret messages and by the posting of inappropriate pictures Some percent said they looked at their spouse s social media with the specific intention of detecting evidence of adultery The underlined word disloyalty in Paragraph probably means A affection B discomfort C dishonesty D violence What might checking spouse s social media accounts result in A The couple let out secrets quickly B The couple lost trust between each other C All the couples quarreled at least once a week D The couple felt comfortable about their relationship By saying Social media is the new marriage minefield Andrew means that A a new marriage needs social media field B social media is a good thing to marriage C social media is a new field of communication D marriage ending will be caused by social media What can be the best title for the passage A Facebook a Multifunctional Tool B Social Media a Threat to Marriage C Posting Pictures is Killing Marriage D Argument about Social Media Sites C The UK remains one of Chinese students top three destination for studying abroad Chinese undergraduates started studying in Britain

would like to have glowing skin especially as we get older The good news is that you don t have to wait until summer to catch some sun rays Scientists have found eating plenty of fruit and vegetables is by far the best way to achieve a healthy golden glow Dr Ian Stephen said Most people think that the best way to improve their skin color is to get a suntan But our research shows that eating lots of fruit and vegetables is actually more effective The team first assessed the skin color of people in relation to their diet Those who ate more fruit and vegetables a day were found to have a more golden yellow skin color Those with a healthy glow had a higher presence of carotenoids which play a role in the immune system Carotenoids are commonly found in fruit and vegetables such an yellow and red peppers spinach apricots and melons The team then studied the relation between skin tone and attractiveness They used specialist software to operate the skin color on the images of faces to simulate more or less carotenoids and suntans Participants were then asked to adjust the skin color to make the faces look as healthy as possible Given the choice between skin color enhanced by suntans and skin color enhanced by carotenoids people preferred the carotenoids skin color The study shows that not only do people use skin color to judge how healthy other individuals are but they are accurate when they make those judgments While this study focus on Caucasian faces it suggests this phenomenon may exist across cultures since similar preferences for skin yellowness are found in an African population Which statement is TRUE according to the text A Carotenoids are only found in the fruit B Carotenoids are important in the immune system C Carotenoids can be improved by catching sun rays D Carotenoids are the only factor that affects the skin color According to the text people preferred A the yellow skin color B the skin color as white as possible C the skin color enhanced by suntans D the skin color enhanced by carotenoids What can we lean from the text A Young girls should not eat many melons B There s no need to worry about our skin color C We cannot judge a person from his appearance D Skin color is a clue to judge whether a person is healthy or not What s the author s intention of writing this passage A To show us how to get glowing skin B To persuade us to get suntans every day C To explain different diets in different cultures D To share his experience of improving the skin Self motivation Self motivation occurs when a person has the willingness to do something and is internally motivated to do it There is a job to go to groceries to do television to watch whoops I guess we get pretty good at finding excuses to escape getting started on goals like an exercise routine or reading a new book The fact is that we are creatures of routine and habit So what can we do to motivate ourselves to accomplish our goals Decide what you want It s hard to motivate an aimless mind Then break it down into smaller sections so it s easier to handle and less overwhelming Keep track of your progress Keep a journal where you can measure how much you have accomplished Post motivating pictures or slogans within your sight It is always inspiring to see pictures of people who have accomplished what you re going for It makes it attainable Likewise little slogans like go for it or just do it can give you the little support you need Once you have accomplished your objective e g becoming an early riser keep it up so that it s second nature to you and you don t have to think about it anymore A Make it a habit B Support yourself with slogans C Our natural tendency is to put off D Here are some tips on how to get moving E In modern society people tend to

several best rules of etiquette that have now disappeared Opening the Door In days gone by a gentleman would always open doors for ladies This h s now almost entire ly disappeared and it is pot entirely the fault of the men I have seen women laugh at men for opening a door for them They seem to be confusing manners with chauvinism Writing Thank You Notes In days gone by whenever a person received a gift they would write a thank you note as soon as possible Parents would sit children down after a birthday or Christmas and coach them in their first thank you note It is a shame that gift giving has now become a virtual obligation and the idea of a thank you note would be laughed at We seem to have completely lost the concept of correct timing when it comes to parties these days After all a party normally has a guest of honor this is usually the oldest woman present It was considered extremely rude in the past to leave a party before the guest of honor and once the guest of honor

upon your arrive in the country For international students perhaps the most direct impact of culture shock is the variety of accents especially in multicultural countries the U S Canada or Australia

I don t think becoming a mother has made you any more complete fulfilled or wise because you were all of these things before your daughter was born I do think however that her arrival means that she

permanent pictures drawn on the body using colored ink Tattoos are often used to show one s skin and beliefs However tattoos and other kinds of body art are also used for very important and ceremonial reasons The most widely used form of body art is henna painting Painting the body with henna is practiced in a number of Asian and African countries The leaves of the henna plant are used to paint the skin a reddish brown color People in Morocco a country Africa use henna paint to protect themselves from evil spirits and prevent bad luck In Sudan henna represents happiness Sudanese women paint henna on their bodies and hair to show how much they love their husbands The more henna painting on a woman the more she loves her husband Men in Sudan also paint their bodies with henna leaves on their wedding day Henna painting is an old tradition but nowadays it is also becoming popular in some other parts of the world In India people also use henna to paint beautiful and detailed patterns on their bodies This art form has been practiced in India for centuries mainly among women It is commonly seen at Indian celebrations and brides will have their hands and feet painted a few days before their wedding Traditionally the darker the paint is the longer their love for their husband will last The color rubs off after some time so it is important for the women to paint themselves as dark as possible Some young women in Western countries have become interested in it as a way to make themselves beautiful In this way traditional art forms become popular in modern society In Australia the Aboriginals use colored clay to paint their faces and bodies for special dances and celebrations For them body art is an important part of celebrations They also use body art to communicate and to express their creativity In fact the same kind of clay is also used to make art in caves and on rocks Some cultures have been practicing body art for thousands of years Learning about these unique forms of cultural expressions is an interesting way of finding about other cultures and societies According to paragraph what are Tattoos A An Indian art B A modern invention C A form of body art D Permanent colored ink Where do Sudanese people paint henna A On their faces only B On their hair and bodies C On their hair only D On people s bodies during dances Brides in India paint their bodies A to show their love B to keep them safe C to make them popular D to enjoy special dances Which of the following statements is true A In Morocco people use henna painting to express their creativity B Sudanese men and women paint themselves only before wedding day C In India people use henna to paint their bodies because it can last forever D Australian Aboriginals use the same clay on their bodies and in their artwork D There was a time when a trip to the supermarket in the United States often ended with a seemingly simple question from the cashier Paper or plastic Well which type of bag would you choose While all types of bags have some influence on the environment it has long been supposed that paper bags are kinder They are made from a renewable source break down easily burn without giving off thick smoke and can be recycled However the producing process behind paper bags uses more energy than that of plastic ones How can this be true Studies show that paper bag production requires four times as much energy as plastic bag production And the amount of water used to make them is twenty times higher Besides the influence on forests is very serious It takes about fourteen million trees to produce ten billion paper bags which happens to be the number of bags used in the United States yearly In terms of recycling the idea that paper bags are more environment friendly than plastic ones can be quickly discarded Research shows it requires about less energy to recycle plastic than it does paper Even though paper bags might be more harmful than plastic ones plastic still seems to be considered by governments as the more harmful of the two In Ireland for example a tax has been introduced to discourage the use of plastic bags People have to pay cents for every plastic bag and as a result their use has dropped quickly There s no doubt that it makes more sense to reuse these bags However we don t seem to be doing that at present That may be because they fall apart quickly If so cloth bags are a better choice but still their production also has a bad influence on the environment So what to do How should we answer the question of Paper or plastic It seems that we first need to ask ourselves one more general question What can I do to help the environment The questions in Paragraph are used to A express the author s doubts B tell readers how to save money C introduce points for discussion D show the kindness of the cashier Compared with plastic bags paper bags A need more water to produce B require less energy to recycle C take more time to break down D have less influence on forests The underlined word discarded in Paragraph probably means A shared B given up C discussed D put forward Which question does the author probably hope the cashier will ask A Paper or cloth B Paper or plastic C A small bag or big one D A new bag or your own one Yawn If you often feel too tired in the mornings even if you re getting

popular Christmas gifts in the UK and Europe for many years But some people still haven t quite got the message The slogan still holds good Some dogs were rounded up by local government last year because they had been abandoned many of them shortly after the festival season The main reason given by owners for handing their dogs over to the Dogs Trust is that the dogs need more attention than they can give behavioral problems and moving home are also reasons given But Eleanor Silk the Trust s communications director says It s often four or five months after Christmas in early summer when owners find that the dog has got too big and too active or it hasn t been trained properly and has caused damage around the home In any case some organizations that help pets are quick to point out that if you are serious about getting a puppy as a pet Christmas is not the time to do it Puppies need to get used to their new surroundings to be introduced to a routine and to be looked after like small children It s hard to meet any of these needs at Christmas What s more pulling a puppy out of a Christmas stocking in itself sends the wrong message to children it encourages children to think of the puppy as a toy rather than a responsibility Appreciating what you re taking on with a dog can be a sobering realization For life means thinking about the effect they will have on your life It also infers you will need to care for the dog for its entire life According to the passage which of the following is NOT a reason for pets to be abandoned A Pets spread some diseases B Pets damage some things in the house C The owners can t take good care of the pets D The owners have to move to other places The underlined words rounded up in Paragraph mean A given out as gifts B thrown away C raised to make money D gathered into one place The fifth paragraph mainly tells us A bow to take best care of Christmas pets B the right time to have a puppy as a pet C the reasons why Christmas is not the time to get a pet D the worries about Christmas pets from organizations that help pets B According to the comments of the Physical Education teacher Simon A becomes weak because he doesn t exercise at all B likes to work with his classmates C doesn t exercise his body at the right time D is too talkative in the class Which of Simon s subjects will attract the headmaster s attention in

classes B His potential has been fully reflected in science classes C He needs to improve his attitude on certain subjects D His grade in maths makes him a born scientist Based on the school report which of the following statements is true A Simon didn t bother his teacher to revise French B Basically Simon did a good job in science C Simon is a determined learner in English D Simon is able to pay attention to history for long C The Hunan Satellite TV HNTV show Where are we going Dad is a big hit Many famous stars brought their children to a strange village alone and they had to spend hours with their children there The program fully showed us a modern version of the how to be a good father As the young parents today are too busy to take care of their children this new form of Lost on the way played by nanny Daddy and cute kids triggered a lot of people s emotional resonance Both the kids and their parents will find that their hearts are being drawn closer But this kind of feeling has just proved that there is a big spiritual barrier between the modern parents and children The TV shows like Children are hard to support Where are we going Dad Hot Mom and Cute Kids are becoming more and more popular All of these show the new parents confusion in children s education and the appeal for the balance between career and family In real life on the one hand the young parents feel helpless because they are too busy to accompany their children under the pressures of work and life on the other hand they continue to do so The data collected by HNTV shows that nearly two thirds of their audience are female among whom are aged from to We can imagine such a scene that one evening a young mother is watching the show with her young children while her husband is still at work or trapped in socializing or maybe is just playing computer games in the bedroom The story of a child without the company of father is still going on In fact it is sometimes the same to mothers In a modern family it is often the old who take the responsibility of raising a child The participation of mother in the children s education is also very low It is just this kind of confusion where the parents have gone in the modern family education and where the parents will guide their children to go that Where are we going Dad shows us If a child wants to grow up healthily and safely into a modern citizen with independent personality and free spirit it is very important for him or her to follow the parents who serve as their first teacher Maybe this is the real reason why such kind of TV programs could get hot The truth is that children will go where their parents go and society will go where the children go In raising a child in modern society parents should A play computer games with their children B keep their children at home to avoid socializing C break down the barrier between children and teachers D balance well between family and career Which of the following can be inferred in the passage A of the audience of the program are female aged from B Parents shouldn t entirely leave the education of children to the old C The program shows us the confusion where the parents and children will go to play D In a modern family it is often mothers who are responsible for raising a child Which one is the best title of the passage A Confusion Behind Where are we going dad B Modern Education is Important C Nanny Daddy and Cute Kids D New problems in Modern Children s Education What attitude towards modern family education does the author express in the second paragraph A Proud B Optimistic C Worried D Doubtful D It s puzzling isn t it No matter where you try to tickle yourself even on the soles of your feet or under your arms you just can t To understand why you need to know more about how your brain works One of its main tasks is to try to make good guesses about what s going to happen next While you re busy getting on with your life walking downstairs or eating your breakfast parts of your brain are always trying to predict the future Remember when you first learned how to ride a bicycle At first it took a lot of concentration to keep the handlebars steady and push the pedals But after a while cycling became easy Now you re not aware of the movements you make to keep the bike going From experience your brain knows exactly what to expect so your body rides the bike automatically Your brain is predicting all the movements you need to make You only have to think consciously about cycling if something changes like if there s a strong wind or you get a flat tyre When something unexpected happens like this your brain is forced to change its predictions about what will happen next If it does its job well you ll adjust to the strong wind leaning your body so you don t fall Why is it so important for our brains to predict what will happen next It helps us make fewer mistakes and can even save our lives For example when a chief fireman sees a fire he immediately makes decisions about how best to position his men His past experiences help him foresee what might happen and choose the best plan for fighting the fire His brain can instantly predict how different plans would work out and he can rule out any bad or dangerous plans without putting his men at risk in real life So how does all this answer your question about tickling kids Because your brain is always predicting your own actions and how your body will feel as a result you cannot tickle yourself Other people can tickle you because they can surprise you You can t predict what their tickling actions will be What is the best title for this passage A Why Can t I Tickle Myself B The Secret of Cycling C How Does the Brain work D The Importance of Prediction We can infer from Paragraph that A it s nothing serious to get a flat tyre B prediction can be changeable and adaptable C weather changes can be predicted by brain D it s dangerous to cycle in the strong wind The phrase rule out in Paragraph probably means A make rules of B think about C get rid of D carry on The passage is probably taken from A a research paper for doctors B a guidebook for passengers C a scientific report for experts D a science book for children It may have happened to you Your friend comes back from his travels gives you a gift and you think to yourself he bought

Tammie Schrader is so enthusiastic about computer games in education that she thinks they can be used to teach programming skills which will help students in college starting in middle school Canadian teacher Justin Holladay wrote a few simple games to help his students practice math skills and when they caught on he started his own company to create more of them And the University of Washington s Zoran Popovic got more than Washington students to master their lessons this spring by playing a computer game for just a few hours The growing availability of inexpensive tablet computers and a new generation of young teachers who grew up playing on computers have spurred interest in games for serious purposes Six or seven years ago selling games to schools was forbidden said David Martz of Muzzy Lane Software a Boston US company that produces games for publishers such as McCraw Hill Now he said schools are interested in the promise of games perhaps because gaming is so much more popular Software and education companies have tried for many years to combine youngsters passion for computer games with educational progress without much success Popovic thinks the first effort to combine games with education fell flat because they were created by commercial companies These companies were more interested in selling products than seeing students master a skill Teachers say there are some pretty good games in the marketplace now Holladay the math teacher from Alberta Canada began moving paper based math games to the iPad building games that allowed students to compete with each other and giving them instant feedback on their progress The game reinforced the lessons he was teaching and his students had fun playing he said They were a lot more engaged What factors have helped promote computer games in schools according to the article a The affordability of tablet computers b The preferences of young teachers c The advertisements of commercial companies d Parents support e

when we are interested in what we do will we be able to devote ourselves to working hard I will share my own experience with you As is known to us it is not unusual that math is a great barring to girls Thus after failing in the math exams over and over again I lost interest in it completely Luckily my math teacher told me never to give up and helped me which made me crazy about learning it Gradually my interest in math developed little by little which made me willing to spend much time bearing in mind the basic rules and do more basic math exercises every day Meanwhile it equipped me with determination and courage for removing all obstacles to improving my math Eventually I became the top student in math in my class Based on what I have gone through we can draw a conclusion that great importance should be attached to interest to have access to success It is interest that inspires us to reach our aim Text M I want to see about getting a private room as soon as possible Also

got the idea to start Amazon years ago I came across the fact that the Internet usage was growing at percent per year I d never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast and the idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles was very exciting to me I had just turned years old and I d been married for a year I told my wife MacKenzie that I wanted to quit my job and go to do this crazy thing that probably wouldn t work since most start ups don t and I wasn t sure what to expect MacKenzie told me I should go for it As a young boy I d been a garage inventor I d always wanted to be an inventor and she wanted me to follow my passion I was working at a financial firm in New York City with a bunch of very smart people and I had a brilliant boss that I much admired I went to my boss and told him I wanted to start a company selling books on the Internet He took me on a long walk in Central Park listened carefully to me and finally said That sounds like a really good idea but it would be an even better idea for someone who didn t already have a good job That logic made some sense to me and he convinced me to think about it for hours before making a final decision Seen in that light it really was a difficult choice but finally I decided I had to give it a shot I didn t think I d regret trying and failing And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all After much consideration I took the less safe path to follow my passion and I m proud of that choice For all of us in the end we are our choice l What inspired the author with the idea of

in meaning to the underlined sentence A The idea of not trying would keep coming to his mind and disturb him B He would be very excited if he tried it out C He would be always having a doubt if he didn t try D The decision to not try the online bookstore would terrify him Which of the following would be the best title for the passage A Cleverness and Kindness B The Starting of Amazon C

might not regret if he failed the idea D the author might go back to his boss if he failed B With the development of modern society human beings are increasingly invading wild animals habitat as well as the wild plants Nearly a third of the world s cacti are facing the threat of extinction according to a shocking global assessment of the effects Cacti are an important provider of food and water to desert wildlife ranging from wolves and deer to tortoises bats and birds and these fauna spread the plants seeds in return But the International Union for the Conservation of Nature IUCN s first worldwide health check of the plants says that they are coming under huge pressure from human activities such as land use changes commercial and residential developments and shrimp farming But the paper said the driver of cacti species extinction was the uncontrolled collection of live plants and private decorating collections and annual agriculture The findings were described as disturbing by Inger Anderson the IUCN s director general They confirm that the scale of the illegal wildlife trade including the trade in plants is much greater than we had previously thought and that wildlife illegal trade concerns many more species than the elephants which tend to receive global attention Cacti are almost always delicious but unlike most others they store water in their stems alone enabling them to survive extreme draughts The plants can be as small as one centimeter in diameter and grow above meters in height Well over half of the species are used by humans for display decoration food or medicine Almost types of cacti were surveyed by the IUCN specialists over a five year period mostly in America Dealing with the illegal trade is a hard task as they can be hidden in suitcases or even socks While countries such as Peru have made progress in blocking the illegal trade the IUCN is calling for more strictly carrying out the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species Cites in the hotspots of Uruguay Brazil and Chile Mexico has made advances but still has work to do according to Goettsch What does the third paragraph mainly tell us A What causes cacti species extinction B What gives people pressure C What IUCN has found D What farmers have planted In Inger Anderson s opinion the findings of the IUCN are not disturbing B the illegal plant trade is less serious than we had thought C cacti have received much global attention D the illegal plant trade threatens lots of wildlife Why is it hard to fight against cacti trade A Because cacti can be made into socks B Because cacti are easy to carry secretly C Because many countries carry out Cites strictly D Because some countries made advances to trade cacti C It is widely acknowledged that nearly every kid might come across some kind of school bullying however the age at which kids first fall victim to bullying could influence how strongly they are affected suggests a new study And surprisingly it is not the youngest kids who are hurt the most in the long term Bullying can have long lasting effects but particularly when it begins in adolescence the researchers say people subjected to either verbal or physical bullying are known to be at greater risk of developing depression anxiety disorders or to behave violently But not everyone reacts in this way Children bullied for the first time before they hit adolescence seem to get over it but those who are bullied for the first time later on in adolescence seem to become more aggressive or are more likely to turn to drink as the conclusions of psychologist Matthew Newman and colleagues of Texas at Austin US The team gave questionnaires to nearly college students regarding their experience of physical and psychological bullying before adolescence before high school and in late adolescence at high school They assessed mood and mental state judging by signs of anxiety or depression such as sleeplessness The group was also questioned about how they would react to certain challenges such as humiliation People who were bullied all revealed slightly higher levels of stress But while those bullied earlier in life seemed to respond normally to provocation people bullied for the first time late in adolescence are more withdrawn and sensitive to violence There are also sex differences between those bullied for the first time during adolescence with females more likely to react aggressively when provoked and males are much more likely to turn to alcohol to escape bad situations The best solution in all cases was strong social support whether from friends family or school Those with no one to share their problems with suffered the most So perhaps it is best not to shelter children completely from bullying early on suggests Newman They may get stressed but unhealthy coping really jumps out when they are bullied for the first time later on What determines the degree of bullying s effect on people according to the study A The reason why they are bullied B The place where they are first bullied C The age at which they are first bullied D The person who first bullies them What may happen to those first bullied later on in adolescence according to Newman and his colleagues A Some are likely to be more aggressive B They seem to easily get over the effect of bullying C Most of them will respond to bullying normally D Most of them are afraid of sharing their problems What does the underlined word humiliation in Paragraph mean A Carrying out an important plan B Being made to feel ashamed C Trying hard to survive an accident D Feeling hopeless in an emergency The sex differences between people bullied for the first time during adolescence are reflected in A the support they get from the society B the effect bullying has on them C the way they react to provocation D the type of bullying they receive D Account Manager Sales Company Name Hiap Moh H K Co Limited The main

or the last child in your family Or were you a middle or an only child Some people think matters where you were born in your family But there are different ideas about what birth order means Some people say that oldest children are smart and strong willed are very likely succeed The reason this is simple Parents have a lot of time for their first child and give him or her a lot of attention An only child will succeed for same reason What happens to the children in the family Middle children don t get so much attention so they don t feel that important If a family has many children the middle one sometimes gets lost in the crowd The youngest child often gets special treatment Often this child grows up to be funny But a recent study saw things quite difference The study found that first children believed in family rules They didn t take many chances in lives They usually follow orders Rules didn t mean as much to later children in the family They took chances and they often did

reading his book His grandson wanted to be just like him and tried to copy him in every way he could One day the grandson asked Grandpa I try to read the book just like you but I don t understand it and I forget what I understand as soon as I close the book What good does reading the book do The grandpa quietly turned from putting coal in the stove and replied Take this coal basket down to the river and bring me back a basket of water The boy did as he was told but all the water leaked out before he got back to the house The grandpa laughed and said You ll have to move a little faster next time and sent him back to the river with the basket to try again This time the boy ran faster but again the basket was empty before he returned Out of breath he told his grandpa that it was impossible to carry water in a basket so he went to get a bucket instead The grandpa said I don t want a bucket of water I want a basket of water You re just not trying hard enough The boy again dipped the basket into the river and ran hard but when he reached his grandpa the basket was empty again Out of breath he said Grandpa it s useless So you think it is useless the grandpa said Look at the basket The boy looked at the basket and for the first time he realized that the basket was different It had been transformed from a dirty old coal basket and was now clean Grandson that s what happens when you read the book You might not understand or remember everything but when you read it you ll be changed inside and out What puzzled the grandson most was A why he forgot what he read soon B whether it was useful to read books C what kind of book he could understand D how he could read books like his grandpa Why did Grandpa ask his grandson to fetch a basket of water A To get him to realize the use of reading books B To punish him for not reading carefully C To clean the dirty basket in the river D To train him to run faster What lesson can we learn from the story A The old are always wiser than the young B It is foolish to carry water with a basket C You can t expect to remember all you read D Reading books can change a person gradually What can be the best title for the text A Grandpa and grandson B Carrying water in a basket C Baskets and books D Reading for total changing B There is a famous story about British poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge He was writing a poem when he was interrupted by a knock at the door This was an age before telephones Someone was delivering a message When Coleridge got back to his poem he had lost his inspiration His poetic mood had been broken by the knock on his door His unfinished poem which could otherwise have been a masterpiece would now never be more than a fragment This story tells how unexpected communication can destroy an important thought which brings us to the cell phone The most common complaint about cell phones is that people talk on them to the annoyance of people around them But more damaging may be the cell phone s interruption of our thoughts We have already entered a golden age of little white lies about our cell phones and this is by and large a healthy protective development I didn t hear it ring or I didn t realize my phone had shut off are among the lies we tell to give ourselves space where we re beyond reach The notion of being unreachable is not a new concept we have Do Not Disturb sign on the doors of hotel rooms So why must we feel guilty when it comes to cell phones Why must we apologize if we decide to shut off the phone for a while Now time alone or a conversation with someone next to us which cannot be interrupted by a phone is something to be cherished Even cell phone devotees myself usually included can t help at times wanting to throw their phones away or curse the day they were invented But we don t and won t and there really is no need All that s required to take back our private time is a general social recognition that we have the right to it In other words we have to develop a healthy contempt for the rings of our own phones A cell phone call deserves no greater priority than a random word from the person next to us though the call on my cell phone may be the one in a million from Steven Spielberg who has finally read my novel and wants to make it his next movie But most likely it is not and I m better off thinking about the idea I just had for a new story or the slice of pizza I ll eat for lunch What is the point of the anecdote about the poet Coleridge in the first three paragraphs A To emphasize the disadvantage of not having a cell phone B To encourage readers to read the works of this poet C To show how important inspiration is to a poet D To direct readers attention to the main topic What does the writer think about people telling white lies about their cell phones A It is a way of signaling that you don t like the caller B It is basically a good way to protect one s privacy C We should feel guilty when we can t tell the truth D It is natural to tell lies about small things According to the author what is the most annoying problem caused by cell phones A Cell phones interrupt people s private time B With cell phones it is no longer possible to be unreachable C People feel guilty when they are not able to answer their cell phones D People get so obsessed with the cell phone rings that they fail to notice anything else What does the last paragraph imply A Never let cell phones disturb your life too much B A person who calls us from afar deserves more of our attention C Steven Spielberg once called the author to talk about the author s novel D You should always finish your lunch before you answer a call on the cell phone C Dear all Please read Professor Hume s email about his next lecture on Rosa Parks Susan Miller Secretary Dear Susan Please forward this message to students of my history class Besides the life story of Rosa Parks in the textbook the students are also required to read the passage below and some related stories that can be borrowed from the school library Ted Hume The early experiences of Rosa Parks long known as the mother of the civil rights movement were not different from those of many African Americans at that time The black woman however turned the course of American history in December when she refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man By sitting down remarked John Lewis She was standing up for all Americans Among the numerous awards Parks received in her life were the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal Parks died on Oct At St Paul A M E Church in Montgomery a large crowd including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice celebrated her life Rice said she and others who grew up when the political activities of Parks held public attention might not have realized her impact on their lives but I can honestly say that without Mrs Parks I probably would not be standing here as Secretary of State After her casket was placed at the Capitol U S President Bush members of Congress and ordinary Americans paid their respects In American history Parks is the first woman to lie in state at the Capitol a very high regard usually reserved for Presidents of the United States What is the main purpose of Susan s email A To introduce to the students Rosa Parks B To help the students organize a lecture C To answer Professor Hume s last email D To make arrangements for Professor Hume s class What does the underlined word forward mean A Read B Explain C Send D Take The political impact of Rosa Parks lies in the fact that she A joined the civil rights movement at a young age B made racial equality a common value in American society C helped Condoleezza Rice achieve political success D set a good example in her early life for other black Americans How was Rosa Parks treated after her death A She was honored to lie in state at the Capitol B She was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom C She was received by President Bush at the Capitol D She was named mother of the civil rights movements D YOU CAN T DO IT EVEN IF IT HURTS NOBODY Who do you think breaks the law in our society If you believe that only tough guys commit crimes you may have to think again Unlike in the movies we can t divide the world into bad guys and model citizens Real life is much more complex In the same way that diseases range from the common cold to fatal forms of cancer crimes vary in degree For example smoking in an elevator will inconvenience people but much less than threatening them with a gun In addition to breaking the law themselves people tolerate various levels of crime Why can we tolerate some crimes It may be that by seeing others do something we accept it more easily For instance most people will find it easier to speed on a highway when everybody else is driving over the speed limit When people celebrate a sports championship if they see someone breaking store windows they might start breaking windows themselves or even steal from the store So the people around us influence how much law breaking we can tolerate We must also wonder whether seeing violence on television or reading about it in the newspapers every day makes us tolerate crime more than we should We become used to seeing blood on the news on television or in full color in newspapers and magazines Because we see thousands of dead people on TV maybe we just try to ignore the situation behind the violence If so many citizens tolerate violence and crime or even commit crimes themselves it may simply be because of the human mind Our minds may not care about specific laws Instead our minds may have a system of values that usually prevents us from hurting other people to improve our own lives Yet when it comes to respecting the rights of a mass of anonymous individuals we might not be so responsible While most people would not steal a wallet containing they may not mind cheating on taxes because cheating on taxes does not hurt anyone person It hurts society but society remains an abstract idea that is not as real as a neighbor or a friend s friend When we realize that many people have misunderstandings of law breaking we could think it is surprising that so many people have a criminal record How could we improve the level of honesty in our society Would strict laws help make our society better Probably not Honesty will have to come from social pressure in the family at school on the job each and every one of us can encourage honesty by showing which behavior is unacceptable And teaching respect should become everyone s responsibility According to the author Real life is much more complex probably means A smoking in an elevator goes against laws in the real life B there is a wide range of people and crimes in the real life C there are much more crimes than diseases in the real life D some model citizens sometimes break laws in the real life People tolerate violence and crime because A they hold mistaken beliefs about law breaking B most unlawful acts are not harmful to the individual C they pay no attention to the truth behind the crimes D their behavior is the same as that of most other people What is the author s purpose in writing this passage A To explain why many people have criminal records B To show people the importance of education C To discuss whether laws are strict enough D To remind people to behave with honesty Muzak The next time you go into a bank a store or a supermarket stop and listen What do you hear It s similar to the music you listen to but it s not exactly the same

are happy when their songs are chosen Why Music is often played in public places because it is designed to make people feel less lonely when they are in an airport or a hotel It has been proven that Muzak does what it is designed to do Tired office workers suddenly have more energy when they hear the pleasant sound of Muzak in the background Supermarket shoppers buy percent more groceries They say it s boring to hear the same songs all the time But other people enjoy hearing Muzak in public places They say it helps them relax and feel calm One way or another Muzak affects everyone Some

Remember the rules above and you will have a pleasant trip here Yours Li Hua A Who s in control of your life Who is pulling your string For the majority of us it s other people society colleagues friends family or our religious community We learned this way of operating when we were very young of course We were brainwashed We discovered that feeling important and feeling accepted was a nice experience and so we learned to do everything we could to make other people like us As Oscar Wilde puts it Most people are other people Their thoughts are someone else s opinions their lives a mimicry their passions a quotation So when people tell us how wonderful we are it makes us feel good We long for this good feeling like a drug Therefore we are so eager for the approval of others that we live unhappy and limited lives failing to do the things we really want to Just as drug addicts and alcoholics live worsened lives to keep getting their fix We worsen our own existence to get our own constant fix of approval But just as with any drug there is a price to pay The price of the approval drug is freedom the freedom to be ourselves The truth is that we cannot control what other people think People have their own agenda and they come with their own baggage and in the end they re more interested in themselves than in you Furthermore if we try to live by the opinions of others we will build our life on sinking sand Everyone has a different way of thinking and people change their opinions allthe time The person who tries to please everyone will only end up getting exhausted and probably pleasing no one in the process So how can we take back control I think there s only one way make a conscious decision to stop caring what other people think We should guide ourselves by means of a set of values not values imposed from the outside by others but innate values which come from within If we are driven by these values and not by the changing opinions and value systems of others we will live a more authentic effective purposeful and happy life What Oscar Wilde says implies that A most people s thoughts are controlled by others B most people have a variety of thoughts C we have thoughts similar to those of others D other people s thoughts are more important What does the author try to argue in the third paragraph A We need to pay for what we want to get B Changing opinions may cost us our freedom C We may lose ourselves to please others D The price of taking drugs is freedom In order to live a happy effective and purposeful life we should A care about others opinions and change opinions all the time B guide ourselves by means of values from the outside C stick to our own values D persuade others to accept our opinions It can be concluded from the passage that A it s important to accept others opinions B it s better to do what we like C we shouldn t change our own opinions D we shouldn t care what others think too much B A Hong Kong Disneyland park

Kong Disneyland Ticket Express on Sundays you have to get there before A pm B pm C pm D pm C Thousands of taxi drivers in Shenyang Liaoning province reportedly blocked streets with their vehicles on Sunday in protest against unlicensed vehicles using taxi hiring apps and apps based car rental companies providing passenger services including high end cars Although the drivers also complained about the withdrawal of the fuel subsidy by the government their main complaint was the loss of business because of the rising number of Internet based car services companies On Wednesday news reports came that Beijing transport authorities will take measures to stop the illegal taxi business of private cars through the newly rising Internet apps following the footsteps of Shenyang and Nanjing It is not yet clear how the Shenyang city government will handle the issue and whether it will declare the services offered by market leaders such as Didi Dache a taxi hiring app provider backed by Tencent Holdings and Kuaidi Dache illegal But Shanghai transport regulators have set a rule by banning Didi Zhuanche or car services offered by Didi Dache in December Such regulations will cause a setback to the car hiring companies and investors that are waiting to cash in on the potentially booming business Just last month Didi Dache got million in funding from global investors including Singapore state investment company Temasek Holdings Russian investment company DST Global and Tencent Besides the market is uncertain that Kuaidi Dache is about to finalize its latest round of funding after getting million from global investors Regulatory uncertainties however could cast a shadow on the future of the Internet based car hiring services which have become popular in most of China s big cities To be fair these companies business model is anything but bad For example Didi Zhuanche works side by side with established car rental companies to provide high end car service mainly for businesspeople through the Internet and mobile phone apps Every link in this business model chain has legal companies and services Hence it is hard to define it as illegal and ban it Why did taxi drivers in Shenyang block the streets with their vehicles A Because they wanted the authority to increase their driving allowances B Because they wanted to be taught how to use the taxi hiring apps C Because they wanted to make their main complaints known to the authority D Because they wanted to appeal to passengers not to hire the private cars The author s attitude to banning internet car hiring service is A positive B negative C neutral D unclear Which of the following statements is false according to the passage A The problem referred to in the passage exists in all cities B App based car rental is functional to some degree C The government should regulate the app based car rental market D Didi Dache is a China foreign joint company we can learn from the passage that A Shenyang forbade apps based car rental companies B Shanghai is the second city banning Didi Zhuanche C some international investment companies have strong faith in the future of apps based car rental companies D it is not difficult to picture the apps based car rental companies illegal D Generally speaking government regulations normally ban anything from smoking in public places to parking in certain zones But officials in the Brazilian town of Biritiba Mirim km miles east of Sao Paulo have gone far beyond that They plan to prohibit residents from dying early because the local cemetery has reached full capacity There s no more room to bury the dead they can t be cremated and laws forbid a new cemetery So the mayor has proposed a strange solution outlaw death Mayor Roberto Pereira says the bill is meant as a protest against federal regulations that prohibit new or expanded cemeteries in preservation areas They have not taken local demands into consideration he claims A decree by Brazil s National Environment Council forbids burial grounds in protected areas Mr Pereira wants to build a new cemetery but the project has been stopped because of Biritiba Mirim is considered as a preservation area Biritiba Mirim a town of inhabitants not only wants to prohibit residents from passing away The bill also calls on people to take care of their health in order to avoid death I haven t got a job nor am I healthy And now they say I can t die That s ridiculous Amarido do Prado an unemployed resident said The city council is expected to vote on the regulation next week Of course the bill is laughable illegal and will never be approved said Gilson Soares de Campos an assistant of the mayor But can you think of a better resolution to persuade the government to change the environmental decree that is prohibiting us from building a new cemetery The bill states that offenders will be held responsible for their acts However it does not say what the punishment will be What is the bill to be proposed by the officials in Biritiba Mirim A Ban on building a new cemetery B Ban on parking in certain zones C Forbidding buried grounds in preservation D Prohibiting residents from dying early What can we infer from the phrase have gone far beyond that in the first paragraph A The officials in Biritiba Mirim have made these regulations B The officials in Biritiba Mirim have been to many places around the world C The bill to be proposed by officials in Biritiba Mirim is much too unexpected D The officials in Biritiba Mirim have built too many cemeteries in their town What s the attitude of the mayor of Biritiba Mirim towards the federal regulations A He remains silent about them B He gives strong backing to them C He objects to them D He asks the residents for advice on them Which of the following is TRUE according to the text A The mayor of the town wants to build a new cemetery against federal regulation B The residents of the town sing high praise for the bill C No better resolution of the problems has been thought out D The government is going to change the environmental decree l A major source of teen stress is school exams and test anxiety is not

Deciding to read and sort them I asked them if I could take the letters back to my Illinois home They As I carefully opened each letter of them fragile with age I discovered a new page unknown to me

lipstick kiss I was to these letters like a magnet Just six weeks after our Christmas visit Daddy became very and was hospitalized This time he was fighting a kind of war As I sat by his bedside we

March Summer Science Class s courses are A only about science subjects B cooperated by several organizations C from July through August D hosted by the world s leading professors Where can you find the article A From a web site B From a traveling brochure C From a novel book D From one famous magazine B The Great Gatsby Lord of the Flies and The Catcher in the Rye these books are usually among the reading lists given to students in the US They all have something in common the writers are all white men As the literary ideas taught in today s schools are often the groundwork for further education critics believe that reading mostly white male views could have negative effects on students Scott Campbell an English teacher at New Trier High School said he believes this fact comes from social oppression Women a hundred or so years ago were not encouraged or expected that they might write so we re left with literature that seems unbalanced Campbell explained This is just one of the after effects of male domination Some schools have started to change that Hancock High School in Michigan has included books that teachers believe to be more culturally relevant to their students Themes have included power and justice family and women s rights which are taught through The Kite Runner and The Woman Warrior Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts respectively Hancock junior Sandra Rodriguez said she welcomes her school s efforts to replace some of the traditional high school reads These books just talk about men and men and men And they never actually show women actually doing something she said You have to read something you feel good about Still some students warn that there s a fine line between a curriculum that reflects their culture and one that s trying too hard We come from a Hispanic culture but even when they give us Hispanic books it s like the same book over and over Hispanic kid wants to go into the white community and not get looked down upon said Hancock senior Lisseth Perez Why do the reading lists for American students need improving A the literary ideas stated in the books of the lists are out of date B the lists overemphasize the topic of social oppression C the lists are dominated by the works of white male authors D the lists don t contain any works by modern writers According to the passage what kind of novel is the The Kite Runner A Valuable family values B the theme of the power and justice C Equal rights for men and women D Huge changes in the Hispanic community What did Lisseth Perez think of the Hispanic books on her reading list A exciting B boring C inspiring D Confusing What do the books in the reading lists for American students have in common A They are about power and justice B They are about families and women s rights C They are about social oppression D The authors are white men C Hu Li s heart sank due to the color of the air Driving kilometers from Tianjin City to Beijing last week she held her breath as the air became a charcoal grey haze The year old businesswoman has lived in Beijing for a decade and this past month she said brought the worst air pollution she has ever seen It gave her husband a cough and left her seven year old daughter housebound My husband as well as I is working here so we have no choice she said But if we had a choice we d like to escape from Beijing The extended heavy pollution over the last month which caused punishment in return for a day last week called the airpocalypse by internet users has largely changed the way that Chinese think about the country s air On one day pollution levels were times higher than levels considered safe by the World Health Organization WHO Flights were cancelled Roads were closed One hospital in east Beijing reported they had treated more than children for breathing issues Bloomberg found that for most of January Beijing s air was worse than that of an airport smoking area The smog s most threatening aspect is its high concentration of PM particulate matter that is small enough to breathe deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream causing breathing infections lung cancer and possibly damaging children s development The WHO has estimated that outdoor air pollution accounts for two million deaths per year of them in Asia Which conclusion can we draw from the first paragraph A Hu Li is living in Beijing B Hu Li traveled to Tianjin for business C The haze is harmful to people D The pollution is the worst in Beijing s history The haze affected people mainly in A the way they traveled B the opinion about national air C the way they lived their life D the life style of internet From the passage we know high concentration of PM A can lead to choke B can cause heart cancer C will damage children s development D will damage people s organ What s the best title for the passage A Hu Li s attitudes to Beijing s haze B The damages of Beijing s haze C WHO suggests improving Beijing s air D What caused air pollution in Beijing D Do you believe that things are connected for no scientific reason at all For example do you avoid saying the word four to avoid bad luck If so you have a superstition And you re not alone all kinds of people have them For example Portugal s soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo always steps onto the pitch with his right foot first according to The Telegraph And sports players are not alone in having superstitions A visitor once asked the Nobel Prize winning scientist Niels Bohr whether he really believed that the horseshoe he d hung at his country home was lucky Of course not the Danish physicist said But I understand it s lucky whether you believe in it or not One recent study found that even scientists at MIT and other top US schools tended to look for a meaning in natural events similar to the connection between stepping on the pitch and playing soccer well according to The Atlantic When the researchers gave the scientists little time to answer questions they were twice as likely to agree with statements such as Trees produce oxygen so that animals can breathe than they were when they had more time to think about their reply It seems that fear can make people think differently in this way too In a British study students imagined meeting a witch who said she would cast an evil spell on them About half said a scientist should not be worried about the spell Yet each of them said that personally they wouldn t let the witch do it to them So why are so many of us superstitious Well it seems to be our way of dealing with the unknown Many people quite simply just want to believe Brian Cronk a professor of psychology at Missouri Western State University said in a interview The human brain is always trying to work out why things happen and when the reason is not clear we tend to make up some pretty bizarre explanations And these explanations aren t completely unhelpful In fact superstitions can sometimes work and bring real luck according to psychologists at the University of Cologne in Germany in the May issue of the journal Psychological Science They found that believing in something can improve performance on a task like an exam So what about you What superstitions do you follow to keep you safe and successful Why does the author mention word four in the first paragraph A to prove that it is reasonable to be superstitious B to introduce the readers to the topic of superstitions C to show how foolish it is to believe in superstitions D to discuss the scientific reasons behind superstitions How many examples of superstitions are mentioned in the passage A B C D What s the author s attitude to superstitions A Neutral B Positive C Negative D Unknown What is the best title of the article A How to get rid of superstitions B How superstitions affect our daily lives C How some common superstitions came into being D Why superstitions are common Nature does not hurry yet everything is accomplished Lao Tzu If you are in a city where everyone rushes realize that you don t have to be like everyone else You can be different You can walk instead of driving in rush hour traffic You can be on your iPhone or Blackberry less and disconnected sometimes Your environment doesn t control your life you do I m not going to tell you how to give you a step by step guide to moving slower Do less Cut back on your projects on your task list on how much you try to do each day Focus not on quantity but on quality Save smaller routine tasks for later in the day but give yourself time to focus Have fewer meetings And they eat into your day forcing you to squeeze the things you really need to do into small windows and making you rush When you do the important things with focus without rush there will be things that get pushed back and that don t get done And you need to ask yourself how necessary are these things What would happen if I stopped doing them Practice mindfulness Simply learn to live in the present rather than things so much about future or the past When you eat fully appreciate your food When you are with someone be with them fully When you are walking appreciate your surroundings no matter where you are Try these things out Life is better when unrushed A Start to put off or cancel the unnecessary B Meetings are usually a big waste of time C The world likely won t end if you don t pass one of the examinations D But here are some things to consider and perhaps adopt if they work for your life E Remember the quote if nature can get everything done without rushing so can you F Pick important things or even just one important thing and work on those first G Give yourself more time to get ready and get there I often read of incidents of misunderstanding or conflict I m left Why do these people create mistrust and problems especially with those from other I was growing up in Kuala Lumpur in the early s children from different races and religions played and studied in harmony At that time my family lived a stone s from Ismail s And no one was bothered that Ismail was a Malay Muslim and I was an Indian Hindu we just our differences Perhaps our elders had not filled our heads with unnecessary advice well or otherwise We were nine when we became friends During the school holidays we d the countryside on our bicycles hoping to the unexpected At times Ismail would accompany my family as we made a rare shopping trip to town We would be glad of his When I was twelve my family moved to Johor Ismail s family later returned to their village and I touch with him One spring afternoon in I stopped a taxi in Kuala Lumpur I my destination The driver acknowledged my but did not move off Instead he looked at me Raddar he said using my childhood nickname I was astonished at being so addressed Unexpectedly It was Ismail Even after two we still recognized each other Grasping his shoulder I felt a true affection something to describe If we can allow our children to be without prejudice they ll build friendships with people regardless of race or religion who will be their side through thick and thin On such friendships are societies built and we can

new racing bicycle instead of asking for money from me Then he spent hours and hours on it I loved my son so much I bought him a pair of sunglasses and gloves When my son rode the racing bicycle with them he looked very cool He dreamed taking part in a race and winning On November th my birthday when I went to the kitchen to start the milk and bread in the morning I found beautiful guitar on the table beside which was a card say Happy birthday to my wonderful mother I was surprised and then began to sob I remembered once I joke to my family that I wanted to learn playing the guitar to make my life colorful I had forget it but my son remembered He took it serious and bought me one as a birthday gift When I wondered my son could buy this expensive gift soon I realized that my son had sold his racing bicycle get me the guitar Dear Peter I am writing to ask that you are able to do me a favor I want to have a pen friend hopefully a girl in her early twenties and with interests similarly

sure my mother was ready for it After all it had taken years to persuade her to buy an electric cooker Even so we packed up our old computer and delivered it to my parents home And so began my mother s adventure in the world of computers It also marked the beginning of an unusual teaching task for me I ve taught people of all ages but I never thought I would be teaching my mother how to do anything She has been the one teaching me all my life to cool and sew to enjoy the good times and put up with the bad Now it was my turn to give something back w w w zxxk c o m It wasn t easy at the beginning There was so much to explain and to introduce Slowly but surely my mother caught on making notes in a little notebook After a few months of Scrabble and other games I decided it was time to introduce her to word processing This proved to be a bigger challenge to her so I gave her some homework I asked her to write me a letter using different letter types colors and spaces Are you this

one or two things that are most important to themselves many put friends ahead of homes jobs clothes and cars A true friendship carries a long history of experience that determines who we are and keeps us connected It is a treasure we should prove it Unfortunately the better friends you are the more probably you ll have disagreements And the result can be what you don t want an end to the relationship The good news is that most troubled friendships can be mended First don t let your pride get in your way Most of us can forgive each other when differences are brought out in the open Second apologize when you re wrong even if you ve been wronged Over the course of friendship even the best people make mistakes Sometimes it may be best if the wronged person takes wrong Third see things from your friend s point of view And finally accept that friendships changes as our needs and lifestyles change Making friends can sometimes seem easy The hard part is keeping the connections

proverb plucking up a crop help it grow is based on the following story It is said that a short tempered man in the Song Dynasty was very anxious to help rice crop grow up quickly He was thinking about day and night But the crop was growing much slower than he expected One day he came up with an idea he would pluck up all of his crop a few inches He did so the next day He was very tired doing this for a whole day he felt very happy since the crop did grow high His son heard about this and went to see the crop Unfortunately the leaves of the crop began to wither This proverb is saying we have to let things go in their nature course Being too anxious to help an event develop often result in the contrary to our intention This morning I got up early and went to school as usually only to find there were nobody in the classroom because it is Sunday How a bad memory I have I couldn t help laughing Stand in front of the school gate I began to wonder what to do next Suddenly a good idea

to Oxford University intending to acquire a doctor s degree in literature At Oxford Geisel met Helen Palmer whom he married in Upon his return to America later that year Geisel published cartoons and humorous article for Judge the leading humor magazine in America at that time His cartoons also appeared in major magazines such as Life Vanity fair and Liberty Geisel gained national exposure when he won an advertising contract for an insecticide called Flit He coined the phrase Quick Henry the Flit which became a popular expression Geisel published his first children s book And to Think That I saw It on Mulberry Street in after publishers rejected it He began to work as Dr Seuss on illustrated literature mostly children s literature in the late s publishing the books And to Think That I Saw

Scientists have discovered a real life moral compass in the brain that controls how we judge other people s behavior The region which lies just behind the right ear becomes more active when we think about other people s misdemeanor or good works In an experiment researchers were able to use powerful magnets to disturb this area of the brain and make people temporarily less moral The study discovers that our sense of right and wrong isn t just based on upbringing religion or philosophy but also by the biology of our brains The researchers used a non invasive technique to disrupt the area of the brain The technique generates a magnetic field on a small part of the skull which creates weak electric currents in the brain These currents interfere with nearby brain cells and prevent them from firing normally One story described a man who let his girlfriend walk over a bridge he knew was unsafe The girl survived unharmed Under normal conditions most people rate the man s behavior as unacceptable But after getting the magnetic pulse the volunteers tended to see nothing wrong with his actions and judged his behavior purely on whether his girlfriend survived Another story described two girls visiting a chemical plant where one girl asks her friend to put sugar in her coffee The friend uses powder from a jar marked toxic but as the powder turns out to be sugar Volunteers with a disrupted moral compass tended to rate the girl s behavior as permissible because her friend was not injured even though she was aware the powder came from a jar labeled toxic Throughout the experiment irresponsible or deliberate actions that might have resulted in harm were seen as morally acceptable if the story had a happy ending What s the probable meaning of the underlined word misdemeanor in Paragraph A Behavior B Misdeed C Fate D Adaption The third paragraph mainly tells us A how the powerful magnets disrupt the area of the brain B what harm the powerful magnets bring to the brain C whether the powerful magnets can disrupt the area D how researchers spot the area with powerful magnets What do the two stories want to tell us A People who like playing jokes on others is controlled by moral compass B People judge others behavior acceptable or not by the moral compass C Whether people s behavior is acceptable or not is judged by a happy ending D Different behavior controlled by the moral compass are all acceptable D Most people have some common sense When we see something suspicious on TV in the newspaper or on the Internet we roll our eyes

they are real or not On National Geographic Channel these stories are dissected in full detail in the series Is It Real Thousands of years ago aliens landed on the Earth They tampered with the

was attacking a woman Sue a year old mother had been out for her morning run The deer followed her and edged closer I knew I was in trouble Sue says She went to pick up a stick for self defense and the deer charged It lifted her with its antlers and threw her into the air Sue could feel blood flew down her leg Within seconds the deer had pushed her off the road When Alexis and her father pulled up the deer was throwing Sue like a doll Alexis looked into the woman s terrified eyes and before her father had even stopped the car the teenager jumped quickly out of the car and ran toward the deer I was kicking it to get its attention she says Then her father who had followed his daughter pushed the deer away from the women Alexis helped Sue into the car and then applied a piece of cloth to Sue s injured leg We re going to get you to a hospital Alexis said Then she heard her father shout loudly He had been knocked to the ground Alexis took hold of a hammer from the car and ran to where her father lay on his back She beat the deer s head and neck but the blows didn t scare it away I was losing faith she says A couple more strikes Alexis said her father You can do it Turning the hammer around Alexis closed her eyes and beat the deer s neck with all her strength When she opened her eyes the deer was running away Alexis got in the driver s seat and sped toward the nearest hospital After Sue was treated she tearfully thanked her rescuers You expect a teenage girl to get on the phone and call for help she says not to beat up a deer What was Sue doing when she was attacked by the deer A She was driving home B She was resting on the road C She was taking exercise D She was feeding wild animals What did Alexis do to save Sue A She pushed the deer away B She hit the deer with her feet C She drove the car to hit the deer D She beat the deer with a hammer Which of the following words can best describe Alexis A Brave B Cruel C Energetic D Strong What is the best title for the passage A A Woman Was Seriously Injured B A Dangerous Deer Attacked a Woman C A Girl Rescued Her Father Successfully D A Teenager Saved Others from a Deer Attack C No one would much like the idea of eating pounds of tomatoes a day But if their goodness was put into an easy to swallow pill that you were told might prevent strokes and heart attacks you would probably be putting in an order tomorrow Researchers believe they may have come up with just that after trials The daily pill contains a chemical called lycopene which makes tomatoes red and is known to break down fat in the vessels A Cambridge University study found taking the pills improved blood flow and the lining of vessels in patients with pre existing heart conditions It also increased the flexibility of their vessels by percent The scientists believe it could limit the damage caused by heart disease responsible for deaths a year and help cut the deaths a year from strokes They also hope it could benefit those with arthritis diabetes and even slow the progress of cancer Each pill is equal to eating around pounds of ripe tomatoes Studies have shown eating a Mediterranean style diet rich in tomatoes fish vegetables nuts and olive oil can significantly reduce cholesterol and help prevent cardiovascular disease Preliminary results from a two month trial in which the pill was given to heart disease patients and healthy volunteers with an average age of were presented at a meeting of the American Heart Association It was shown to improve the function of the endothelium the layer of cells lining blood vessels It also improved their sensitivity to nitric oxide the gas which causes the enlargement of the vessels in response to exercise Ian Wilkinson head of Cambridge University s clinical trials unit said These results are potentially very significant and it meets the goal but we need more trials to see if they translate into fewer heart attacks and strokes Further studies are planned with researchers hoping it could offer a choice for heart disease sufferers who can not take the cholesterol lowing drugs Mike Knapton head of the British Heart Foundation said Although this showed lycopene improved blood flow in people with heart disease that s a long way from demonstrating that taking it could improve outcomes for people with heart disease The best way to get the benefits of a good diet is to eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables What can we infer from Paragraph A We can eat too much tomato food B Tomatoes are helpful to strokes and heart attacks C Tomatoes will lose healthy elements when put into pills D We had better not eat tomatoes We can learn from the passage that the pills A are at the experiment stage B can cure all the disease C are widely used among patients D cost patients so little money Who were the volunteers by taking part in the trial A Children B Youth C Working people D Old healthy people What was Ian Wilkinson s opinion on the trial A Surprising B Disappointing C Satisfactory D Terrible D Heaven is where the police are English the cooks are French the mechanics are German the lovers are Italian and everything is organized by the Swiss Hell is where the police are German the cooks are English the mechanics are French the lovers are Swiss and everything is organized by the Italians Obviously the national stereotypes in this old joke are generalizations but such stereotypes are often said to exist for a reason Is there actually a sliver of truth in them Not likely an international research team now says National and cultural stereotypes do play an important role in how people see themselves and others and being aware that these are not dependable is a useful thing said study author Robert McCrae of the National Institute on Aging These are in fact unfounded stereotypes They don t come from looking around you McCrae said If national stereotypes aren t rooted in real experiences then where do they come from One possibility is that they reflect national values which may become known from historical events For example many historians have argued that the spirit of American individualism has its origins in the experiences of the pioneers on the Old West Social scientists such as psychologist Richard Robins have given several other possible explanations for stereotypes and why they may be incorrect Robins notes that some stereotypes may have been correct at one point in history and then remained unchanged while the culture changed We may be hard wired to some degree to keep incorrect stereotypes since we are less likely to notice and remember information that is different from our stereotypes Generally according to Robins when we meet people who are different from our stereotypes we see them as unique individuals rather than typical national or cultural groups The stereotype about Italians is A strict but thoughtful B friendly and good tempered C dreamy and impractical D romantic but disorganized National stereotypes are not always correct because A they are formed by individual historians B people tend to have false idea about other cultures C what was true in the past may not be true at the present D generalizations are made through personal experience According to the research team led by McCrae national stereotypes are A unreliable B harmful C humorous D interesting The underlined word hard wired in the last paragraph probably means A anxious B fixed C helpless D forgetful Handwriting can make or break the first impression If your handwriting is difficult for others to read you will sometimes feel embarrassed It needs lot of practice to improve your handwriting Try each of them out on a piece of paper by signing your name Find out which type of pen you can write best with You may be amazed at the change in your handwriting just by changing to another pen Do not just do what feels comfortable because that is just your old bad habit coming back into play Try to hold the pen lightly and don t press too hard Use your chosen pen to write Os on some pieces of lined paper Write until you have filled up all the lines Be careful with each O that you write Practice writing Os as much as possible Remember practice makes perfect You may practice for weeks or months if you need to As your handwriting shows signs of improvement go ahead and keep on practicing by writing more words A Gather different types of pens B Practice holding your pen in different ways C However a bad writing habit is hard to break D Choose a type of pen with which you write best E It won t help if you write a lot of careless Os on the paper F Two to three months practice is enough to get good handwriting G After you are confident in your Os do the same thing with your name A B C D My mother was a responsible teacher and she retired So I decided to give her one of my old computers to help her pass the time She had a little bit of computer so I just set it up for her and let her with it on her own As time went on I the computer was hardly touched She said she didn t know how to use it I decided to teach her I sat and everything and she seemed OK with what I said my sister called me at that moment we talked on the phone for an hour Then when I saw her again she was sitting in front of the computer looking quite The screen saver had appeared and she didn t know how to it off She had tried every key and it didn t work I told her Just the mouse a little What I meant was that she just needed to move the mouse around to the computer up What she did was to the mouse and start shaking it around in mid air until the went completely black I couldn t help laughing because of her funny The more I laughed the she got She thought that I was a n teacher and she decided to figure the thing out herself Well at least I helped her overcome her of breaking something and encouraged her to a little About a week later I found a home made card with a mouse on the front making a

Born in Yuan graduated from Southwest Agricultural College in Since then finding ways to grow more rice be his life goal As a young man he see the great need for increasing the output At that time hunger was a disturb problem Yuan searched a way to increase rice harvests without expanding the area of the fields In Chinese farmers could produce about million tons of rice In a recent harvest nearly million tons of rice was produced These increased harvests mean now of the world s people feed from of the farmland in the world Yuan is now circulating his knowledge in India Vietnam and many other less developed country to increase their rice harvest Using his hybrid rice farmers are producing harvests two as large as before Last weekend s concert organized and performing by the students

repeated many times in the theater s year history This time however the cleanup was a little different As one group of workers carried out the rubbish another group began removing seats and other theater equipment in preparation for the building s end The film classic The Last Picture Show was the last movie shown in the old theater Though the movie is years old most of the seats were filled with teary eyed audience wanting to say good bye to the old building Theater owner Ed Bradford said he chose the movie because it seemed appropriate The movie is set in a small town where the only movie theater is preparing to close down Bradford said that large modern theaters in the city made it impossible for the Plaza to compete He added that the theater s location was also a reason This used to be the center of town he said Now the area is mostly office buildings and warehouse Last week some city officials suggested the city might be interested in turning the old theater into a museum and public meeting place However these plans were abandoned because of financial problems Bradford sold the building and land to a local development firm which plans to build a shopping complex on the land where the theater is located The theater audience said good bye as Bradford locked the doors for the last time After years the Plaza Theater had shown its last movie The theater will be missed In what way was yesterday s cleanup at the Plaza special A It made room for new equipment B It signaled the closedown of the theater C It was done with the help of the audience D It marked the th anniversary of the theater Why was The Last Picture Show put on A It was an all time classic B It was about the history of the town C The audience requested it D The theater owner found it suitable What will probably happen to the building A It will be repaired B It will be turned into a museum C It will be knocked down D It will be sold to the city government What can we infer about the audience A They are disappointed with Bradford B They are sad to part with the old theater C They are supportive of the city officials D They are eager to have a shopping center C After years of heated debate gray wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park Fourteen wolves were caught in Canada and transported to the park By last year the Yellowstone wolf population had grown to more than wolves Gray wolves once were seen here and there in the Yellowstone area and much of the continental United States but they were gradually displaced by human development By the s wolves had practically disappeared from the Yellowstone area They went farther north into the deep forests of Canada where there were fewer humans around The disappearance of the wolves had many unexpected results Deer and elk populations major food sources for the wolf grew rapidly These animals consumed large amounts of vegetation which reduced plant diversity in the park In the absence of wolves coyote populations also grew quickly The coyotes killed a large percentage of the park s red foxes and completely drove away the park s beavers As early as biologists asked the government to consider reintroducing wolves to Yellowstone Park They hoped that wolves would be able to control the elk and coyote problems Many farmers opposed the plan because they feared that wolves would kill their farm animals or pets The government spent nearly years coming up with a plan to reintroduce the wolves The U S Fish and Wildlife Service carefully monitors and manages the wolf packs in Yellowstone Today the debate continues over how well the gray wolf is fitting in at Yellowstone Elk deer and coyote populations are down while beavers and red foxes have made a comeback The Yellowstone wolf project has been a valuable experiment to help biologists decide whether to reintroduce wolves to other parts of the country as well What is the text mainly about A Wildlife research in the United States B Plant diversity in the Yellowstone area C The conflict between farmers and gray wolves D The reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone Park What does the underlined word displaced in paragraph mean A Tested B Separated C Forced out D Tracked down What did the disappearance of gray wolves bring about A Damage to local ecology B A decline in the park s income C Preservation of vegetation D An increase in the variety of animals What is the author s attitude towards the Yellowstone wolf project A Doubtful B Positive C Disapproving D Uncaring D The Intelligent Transport team at Newcastle University have turned an electric car into a mobile laboratory named DriveLAB in order to understand the challenges faced by older drivers and to discover where the key stress points are Research shows that giving up driving is one of the key reasons for a fall in health and well being among older people leading to them becoming more isolated and inactive Led by Professor Phil Blythe the Newcastle team are developing in vehicle technologies for older drivers which they hope could help them to continue driving into later life These include custom made navigation tools night vision systems and intelligent speed adaptations Phil Blythe explains For many older people particularly those living alone or in the country driving is important for preserving their independence giving them the freedom to get out and about without having to rely on others But we all have to accept that as we get older our reactions slow down and this often results in people avoiding any potentially challenging driving conditions and losing confidence in their driving skills The result is that people stop driving before they really need to Dr Amy Guo the leading researcher on the older driver study explains The DriveLAB is helping us to understand what the key stress points and difficulties are for older drivers and how we might use technology to address these problems For example most of us would expect older drivers always go slower than everyone else but surprisingly we found that in mph zones they struggled to keep at a constant speed and so were more likely to break the speed limit and be at risk of getting fined We re looking at the benefits of systems which control their speed as a way of preventing that We hope that our work will help with technological solutions to ensure that older drivers stay safer behind the wheel What is the purpose of the Drivel AB A To explore new means of transport B To design new types of cars C To find out older driver s problems D To teach people traffic rules Why is driving important for older people according to Phil Blythe A It keeps them independent B It helps them save time C It builds up their strength D It cures their mental illnesses What do researchers hope to do for older drivers A Improve their driving skills B Develop driver assist technologies C Provide tips on repairing their cars D Organize regular physical checkups What is the best title for the text A A new Model Electric Car B A Solution to Traffic Problem C Driving Service for elders D Keeping Older Drivers on the Road Lots of people find it hard to get up in the

into the freezing East River Tuesday s Daily News said year old Julien Duret from France is the man who left the spot quickly after the rescue last Saturday He lifted the little girl out of the water after she fell off the bank at the South Street Scaport museum He handed the girl to her father David Anderson who had dive in after him I didn t think at all Duret told the Daily News It happened very fast I reacted very fast Duret an engineer on vacation was walking with his girlfriend along the pier when he saw something falling into the water He thought it was a doll but realized it was a child when he approached the river In an instant he took off his coat and jumped into the water When he reached the girl she appeared lifeless he said Fortunately when she was out of the water she opened her eyes Anderson said his daughter slipped off the bank when he was adjusting his camera An ambulance came later for her said Duret who was handed dry clothes from onlookers Duret caught a train with his girlfriend shortly after The rescue happened on the day before he left for France Duret said he didn t realize his tale of heroism he was leaving the city the next morning I don t really think I m a hero said Duret Anyone would do the same ting Why was Duret in NewYork A To meet his girlfriend B To work as an engineer C To spend his holiday D To visit the Andersons What did duret do shortly after the ambulance came A He was interviewed by a newspaper B He asked his girlfriend for his dry clothes C He went to the hospital in the ambulance D He disappeared from the spot quickly Who dived after Duret into the river to save the little girl A David Anderson B a passer by C his girlfriend D a taxi driver When was Duet most probably found to be the very hero A the day when he was leaving for home B a couple of days after the girl was rescued C the first day when he was in New York D the same day when he was interviewed C There was a gardener who looked after his garden with great care To water his flowers he used two buckers One was a shiny and new bucket The other was a very old and dilapidated one Which had seen many years of service but was now past its best Every morning the gardener would fill up the two buckets Then he would carry them along the path one on each side to the flowerbeds The new bucket was very proud of itself It could carry a full bucket of water without a single drop spilled The old bucket felt very ashamed because of its holes before it reached the flowerbeds much water had leaked along the path Sometimes the new bucket would say See how capable I am How good it is that the gardener has me to water the flowers every day I don t know why he still bothers with you What a waste of space you are And all that the old bucket could say was I know I am not very useful but I can only do my best I am happy that the gardener still finds a little bit of use in me at least One day the gardener heard that kind or conversation After watering the flowers as usual he said You both have done your work very well Now I am going to carry you back I want you to look carefully along the path Then the two buckets did so All along the path they noticed on the side where the new bucket was carried there was just bare earth one the other side where the old bucket was carried there was a joyous row of wild flowers leading all the way to the garden What does the underlined word dilapidated probably mean A Dirty B Dark C Worn outD Plain looking What was the old bucket ashamed of A His past B His aging C His manner D His leaking The new bucket made conversations with the old one mainly to A laugh at the old one B take pity on the old one C show off its beautiful looks D praise the gardener s kindness Why was the old bucket still kept by the gardener A Because it was used to keep a balance B Because it stayed in its best condition C Because it was taken as a treasure D Because it had its own function D Humans are naturally drawn to other life forms and the worlds outside of our own We take delight in the existence of creatures and even whole societies beyond our everyday lives This sense of wonder is universal Look at the efforts that scientists have made to find out whether life of some kind exists on Mars and the popularity of fantasy literature or movies like The Lord of the Rings This sense of wonder draws us to each other to the world around us and to the world of make believe But have we gone so far in creating worlds of fantasy that we are missing the pleasure of other worlds that already exist all around us Human beings as biologists have suggested possess an inborn desire to connect with and understand other life forms However people especially in big cities often lead rather isolated lives In a study of British schoolchildren it was found that children by age eight were much more familiar with characters from television shows and video games than with common wildlife Without modem technology a small pond could be an amazing world filled with strange and beautiful plants insects birds and animals When we lack meaningful interaction with the world around us and sometimes even with our families and friends we seek to understand and communicate with things that exist only in our imaginations or on a computer screen The world of make believe is not necessarily bad But when the world of fantasy becomes the only outlet for our sense of wonder then we are really missing something We are missing a connection with the living world Other wonderful worlds exist all around us But even more interesting is that if we look closely enough we can see that these worlds in a broad sense are really part of our own The popularity of the lord of the rings proves A the close connection between man and the fantasy world B the wonderful achievements of fantasy literature C the fine taste of moviegoers around the world D the general existence of the sense of curiosity What can we infer from the underlined sentence in Paragraph A people are far less familiar with the world of fantasy B the world around us could serve as a source of wonder C the world of fantasy can be mirrored by a small and lively pond D Modern technology prevents us from developing our sense of wonder If our sense of wonder relies totally on the world of make believe we will A fail to appreciate

mankind might be regarded as making up several levels The first and most basic level of wants involves food Once this want is satisfied a second level of wants appears clothing and some sort of shelter By the end of World War II these wants were satisfied for a great majority of Americans It included such items as automobiles and new houses By or this third level of wants was fairly well satisfied Then in the late s a fourth level of wants appeared the life enriching level While the other levels involve physical satisfaction the feeding comfort safety and transportation of the human body this level stresses mental needs for recognition achievement and happiness It includes a variety of goods and services many of which could be called luxury items Among them are vacation trips the best medical care and entertainment On this level a greater percentage of consumer spending goes to services while on the first three levels more is spent on goods Will consumers raise their sights to a fifth level of wants as their income increases or will they continue to demand luxuries and personal services on the fourth level A fifth level probably would involve wants that can be achieved best by community action Consumers may be spending more on taxes to pay for government action against disease ignorance crime and prejudice In this way we can enjoy more fully the good things on the first four levels A Then a third level appeared B Different people have different wants on each level C There are several levels of wants in one s life D When there is money enough to satisfy one level of wants another level appears E At this stage we now may seek to ensure the health safety and leisure F Also included here are fancy foods and the latest styles in clothing G Human wants seem endless

the man saw what appeared to be a great cloud following the car When he stopped at a village further on he was told that a queen bee must be hidden in his car as there were thousands of bees On learning this the man drove away as quickly as possible After an hour s driving he arrived safely in London where he parked his car outside a and went in It was not long a customer who had seen him arrive in to inform him that his car was with bees The poor driver was that the best way should be to call a In a short time the man arrived He found the unwelcome passenger hidden near the wheels at

As a child I lived in a poor family The second hand clothes rain leaking roof of old house became part of my memory the worst impression is that I was feeling hungry all the time Sometimes hunger hit me so severely I regarded dried sweet potato slices as delicious snack At that time my dream was getting enough to fill my empty stomach In the early years of the s as the reform and opening up policy carry out our dream came true And then another dream became clearer and clearer in my mind I must try I best to escape out of my poor and backward hometown I worked hard at my study than most of my classmates and after luckily succeed in the national college entrance examination I realized my dream again after graduation I became a citizen working in a city the first college graduate out of a remote village my success set example for my folks They came to realize that schooling is a good way to change one s fate In the follow years there were fewer drop outs and more college graduates in

movie movies the How What different differently me to fallen fall Beside Besides keeping kept A B C D A My daughter Kelly is a cautious person She needs to warm up to situations and is hesitant to try new things When with close friends she becomes a leader who laughs loudly and chants Girls rule boys drool But when that comfort zone is not around her she is shy and nervous This had been challenging for me at times Shy is not a word that I think has ever been used to describe me But this has been a year of firsts for my girl that has filled her with a new sense of confidence This year she moved to lap lane in swimming where she was preparing for a swim team This year she learned to ride a bike without training wheels And this year she completed her first kids triathlon On Saturday with a thunderstorm coming soon and my son s birthday party later in the day we all went out in the dark of the morning for Kelly to participate in her first triathlon We practiced transitions from swim to bike to run with her we got all the equipment she d need and we kept talking about the race But as we waited the two hours for the older kids to finish before her turn she held my leg a little harder and told me she loved me many times She was nervous but trying to keep it together And then it was her turn From the second she jumped into the water my face lit up My daughter transformed into the most confident human being I had ever seen She dominated that swim won that bike ride and ran to the finish with the biggest smile on her face I can honestly say that I never felt so proud of someone in my entire life It wasn t because she did a sport or anything like that It was because she was afraid of something and conquered that fear with confidence and a fire I hadn t seen before All day I would find myself just looking over at her and smiling She might be wearing the finalist medal but I felt like I won that day I won the chance to see my girl shine Shine on sweet baby Kelly is nervous when A situations are new to her B boys are around her C she changes into a leader D she is away from her mom We can know from the Paragraph A the race began in the early morning B the whole family gave Kelly support C Kelly was eager for her turn in the race D Kelly prepared for her brother s birthday party Seeing Kelly s performance in the race the author felt A excited and proud B anxious and uneasy C curious and concerned D worried and hesitant The author felt like I won that day because Kelly A expressed love to her B won the gold medal C took part in the sport D overcame the fear B We ve all had that moment when we are in the middle of sorting old clothes or walking down the street and passing a restaurant or someone hugs you and their pleasant smell go slightly and you re instantly transported to a past memory or you feel an emotional response to that smell For me the smell of bubble bath will always make me think of long soaps in the big claw footed bath and my grandma s house in the UK If this sounds like you too there is a reason for it Psychologist Sabina Read explains Fragrance is commonly linked to our mood and behavior via learned emotional responses associated with smells and past experiences If we smell roses while visiting a sick loved one in hospital the smell may arouse sadness or grief however if we first smell roses after giving birth we will most likely associate that smell with feelings of joy and love Therefore fragrance plays a powerful role in mood and emotion across our life And it s this understanding which Imperial Leather has used in creating their new fragrance range The brand undertook a survey of Australians on fragrances and smells and some of the results might surprise you A huge percent of people feel more confident just by wearing a fragrance Women feel most attractive wearing a floral scent Floral fragrances are the most attractive scent with men voting it as their favorite scent for a partner Over half the nation percent have used the same fragrance for five years or more When we are sorting old clothes their pleasant smell may A be always full of our memory B drive us to change for new ones C have a positive effect on our emotion D remind us a certain past memory or feelings on it By giving examples the writer makes us learn that A roses are always connected with joy and love B fragrance plays an important role in our mood and emotion C the big claw footed bath calls up the memory of his grandma s house D Imperial Leather conducted a survey to create their new fragrance range What would be the best title for the passage A The Truth Behind Fragrances and Feelings B Smell Associated with Emotion C A Survey by Imperial Leather D My Past Memory of Smell What can you do if you want to make yourself attractive A Wear some old clothes full of memories B Take a bubble bath every day C Wear some kind of fragrance D Avoid visiting people in hospital C Teenagers have fewer friends than years ago research has shown despite the increasing popularity of social media A study carried out by experts at The University of Queensland in Australia found teens felt less lonely than two decades ago but that they have poorer social networks A survey of more than US high school students carried out between and found young people had fewer friends with whom to interact but less desire for more friends The Globe and Mail quotes the findings of the research printed in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin which suggests economic changes may have helped increased individuality among young people The authors behind the study wrote Greater economic opportunities offer individuals more freedom to manage their own money decide whom to date and decide whom to marry reducing the influence of relatives and giving people more freedom which may increase individualism Economic changes lead to increased individuality which could lead to decreasing interest in friends increasing self reliance increasing self esteem and decreasing loneliness Lead researcher Dr David Clark said further research on cultures outside the US would help determine if modernization is the root cause of the observed results He said If other cultures show the same pattern of reduced loneliness in the face of poorer social networks this would support the idea that modernization is responsible The findings have shown that the growing use of social networking sites has had a negative effect on the quality of people s friendships A study from by sociologists at Duke University also showed that on average most adults only have two people they can talk to about the most important subjects in their lives while one quarter had no close friends at all Compared with years ago what do we know about teenagers today A They feel more lonely B They have fewer friends C They have wider social networks D They are more eager to make friends What may economic changes make teens do today A Desire more friends B Feel more lonely C Be more independent D Make money more easily In Dr David Clark s view A some adults have no close friends at all B teens should get away from social networks C all cultures show teens today feel less lonely D modernization may cause teens reduced loneliness D I cherish being around people who are totally comfortable with who they are There always seems to be an aura of love and acceptance that follows these people around I think it is because they have figured out one of the biggest secrets to life the chance of being loved and accepted grows so much when we can truly say we couldn t be more comfortable with ourselves People like being round those who are comfortable with themselves because they are less threatening We all feel the need to protect ourselves from threats aimed at our insecurities Insecurities are like open wounds and it hurts when people poke at them It can be exhausting to hang around people who constantly poke at us just to get some kind of external recognition through making everyone else feel smaller My favorite thing about people who are comfortable with themselves is that they need no external recognition They have discovered their worth is by nature something that cannot be taken away or added to according to what other people think Ironically enough this ends up providing comfortable people with more external recognition than those who feel they need it most Because comfortable people s worth comes from within they see no point in tearing others down To them the only sensible way to speak about another is to be positive I guess when you realize your worth comes from within you might as well build others up rather than tear them down since their size is of no threat to your sense of self worth Plus it is a lot more fun to speak love to others and watch their eyes light up than it is to hurt someone s feelings for a cheap laugh anyway When we become comfortable with ourselves through fully accepting who we are we can silence the noise our insecurities make in public situations and enjoy the wonderful reality before us The result is a world with fewer insecurities To me that sounds like a better world Which of the following sayings best express the main idea of the passage A Actions speak louder than words B No pains no gains C Luck favors those who are comfortable with who they are D Don t pretend to know what you don t know What does the underlined word them in Paragraph probably mean A Insecurities B Open wounds C People who are comfortable with themselves D Threats The reasons why the author loves with people who are comfortable with themselves are the following except that A there will be an aura of love and acceptance that follows these people around B they are less threatening C they always have a positive attitude toward others D the author needs external recognition What is the purpose of writing this passage A To give a description of people who are comfortable with themselves B To ask people to make friends with people who are comfortable with themselves C To offer some advice on how to be persons who are comfortable with themselves D To appeal to people to be comfortable with themselves so that we can live in a better world Ways to Improve Your Luck Some people have all the luck Or does it just seem that way Why did your co worker get that big promotion while you were overlooked Why do some of us seem to experience these lucky things more than others and how can you improve your luck What You Tell Yourself Matters Do you know that people who are lucky tell themselves they re lucky Has your own self talk been filled with less than lucky talk Do you say things like I m just not a lucky person or Good things never happen to me They say things like This setback is only temporary I know things will turn around or Things have a way of working out for me Expect and Acknowledge Your Good Luck Research suggests keeping a good luck journal helps people become even luckier Did someone bring you coffee at work today Did you find a random quarter on the street Did your husband or wife do something nice for you today Did your child get a good grade at school Write them down Begin to notice all the good that comes to you Do Something New and Different Make contact with people Take risks People who try new things are much more open to luck and good fortune than those who don t This doesn t mean you have to quit your job or take up skydiving It could be as simple as starting a conversation with a stranger taking a class in an unfamiliar subject learning some words and phrases in a foreign language or trying a new ethnic restaurant And this greater openness can help promote chance opportunities in their lives A All of these things count B You will never forget your lucky friends C Lucky people generally expect good fortune D Here are ideas that researchers tell us about luck E A lucky person generally receive good fortune in the future F Lucky people score much higher on openness than unlucky people G You probably have many more lucky things happening in your life than you think A B C D Mike s New Bike Mike

Saturday He lifted the little girl out of the water after she fell off the bank at the South Street Scaport museum He handed the girl to her father David Anderson who had dive in after him I didn t think at all Duret told the Daily News It happened very fast I reacted very fast Duret an engineer on vacation was walking with his girlfriend along the pier when he saw something falling into the water He thought it was a doll but realized it was a child when he approached the river In an instant he took off his coat and jumped into the water When he reached the girl she appeared lifeless he said Fortunately when she was out of the water she opened her eyes Anderson said his daughter slipped off the bank when he was adjusting his camera An ambulance came later for her said Duret who was handed dry clothes from onlookers Duret caught a train with his girlfriend shortly after The rescue happened on the day before he left for France Duret said he didn t realize his tale of heroism he was leaving the city the next morning I don t really think I m a hero said Duret Anyone would do the same ting Why was Duret in NewYork A To meet his girlfriend B To work as an engineer C To spend his holiday D To visit the Andersons What did duret do shortly after the ambulance came A He was interviewed by a newspaper B He asked his girlfriend for his dry clothes C He went to the hospital in the ambulance D He disappeared from the spot quickly Who dived after Duret into the river to save the little girl A David Anderson B a passer by C his girlfriend D a taxi driver When was Duet most probably found to be the very hero A the day when he was leaving for home B a couple of days after the girl was rescued C the first day when he was in New York D the same day when he was interviewed C There was a gardener who looked after his garden with great care To water his flowers he used two buckers One was a shiny and new bucket The other was a very old and dilapidated one Which had seen many years of service but was now past its best Every morning the gardener would fill up the two buckets Then he would carry them along the path one on each side to the flowerbeds The new bucket was very proud of itself It could carry a full bucket of water without a single drop spilled The old bucket felt very ashamed because of its holes before it reached the flowerbeds much water had leaked along the path Sometimes the new bucket would say See how capable I am How good it is that the gardener has me to water the flowers every day I don t know why he still bothers with you What a waste of space you are And all that the old bucket could say was I know I am not very useful but I can only do my best I am happy that the gardener still finds a little bit of use in me at least One day the gardener heard that kind or conversation After watering the flowers as usual he said You both have done your work very well Now I am going to carry you back I want you to look carefully along the path Then the two buckets did so All along the path they noticed on the side where the new bucket was carried there was just bare earth one the other side where the old bucket was carried there was a joyous row of wild flowers leading all the way to the garden What does the underlined word dilapidated probably mean A Dirty B Dark C Worn outD Plain looking What was the old bucket ashamed of A His past B His aging C His manner D His leaking The new bucket made conversations with the old one mainly to A laugh at the old one B take pity on the old one C show off its beautiful looks D praise the gardener s kindness Why was the old bucket still kept by the gardener A Because it was used to keep a balance B Because it stayed in its best condition C Because it was taken as a treasure D Because it had its own function D Humans are naturally drawn to other life forms and the worlds outside of our own We take delight in the existence of creatures and even whole societies beyond our everyday lives This sense of wonder is universal Look at the efforts that scientists have made to find out whether life of some kind exists on Mars and the popularity of fantasy literature or movies like The Lord of the Rings This sense of wonder draws us to each other to the world around us and to the world of make believe But have we gone so far in creating worlds of fantasy that we are missing the pleasure of other worlds that already exist all around us Human beings as biologists have suggested possess an inborn desire to connect with and understand other life forms However people especially in big cities often lead rather isolated lives In a study of British schoolchildren it was found that children by age eight were much more familiar with characters from television shows and video games than with common wildlife Without modem technology a small pond could be an amazing world filled with strange and beautiful plants insects birds and animals When we lack meaningful interaction with the world around us and sometimes even with our families and friends we seek to understand and communicate with things that exist only in our imaginations or on a computer screen The world of make believe is not necessarily bad But when the world of fantasy becomes the only outlet for our sense of wonder then we are really missing something We are missing a connection with the living world Other wonderful worlds exist all around us But even more interesting is that if we look closely enough we can see that these worlds in a broad sense are really part of our own The popularity of the lord of the rings proves A the close connection between man and the fantasy world B the wonderful achievements of fantasy literature C the fine taste of moviegoers around the world D the general existence of the sense of curiosity What can we infer from the underlined sentence in Paragraph A people are far less familiar with the world of fantasy B the world around us could serve as a source of wonder C the world of fantasy can be mirrored by a small and lively pond D Modern technology prevents us from developing our sense of wonder If our sense of wonder relies totally on the world of make believe we will A fail to appreciate the joy in our lives B be confused by the world of make believe C miss the chance to recognize the fantasy world D be trapped by other worlds existing all around us What is the main purpose of the passage A To show us the hidden beauty in our world B to warn us not to get lost in the fantasy world C To argue against the misuse of the sense of wonder D To discuss the influence of the world of make believe When a starving man gets a meal he begins to think about an overcoat when an executive gets a new sports car visions of country clubs and pleasure beats dance into view The many wants of mankind might be regarded as making up several levels The first and most basic level of wants involves food Once this want is satisfied a second level of wants appears clothing and some sort of shelter By the end of World War II these wants were satisfied for a great majority of Americans It included such items as automobiles and new houses By or this third level of wants was fairly well satisfied Then in the late s a fourth level of wants appeared the life enriching level While the other levels involve physical satisfaction the feeding comfort safety and transportation of the human body this level stresses mental needs for recognition achievement and happiness It includes a variety of goods and services many of which could be called luxury items Among them are vacation trips the best medical care and entertainment On this level a greater percentage of consumer spending goes to services while on the first three levels more is spent on goods Will consumers raise their sights to a fifth level of wants as their income increases or will they continue to demand luxuries and personal services on the fourth level A fifth level probably would involve wants that can be achieved best by community action Consumers may be spending more on taxes to pay for government action against disease ignorance crime and prejudice In this way we can enjoy more fully the good things on the first four levels A Then a third level appeared B Different people have different wants on each level C There are several levels of wants in one s life D When there is money enough to satisfy one level of wants another level appears E At this stage we now may seek to ensure the health safety and leisure F Also included here are fancy foods and the latest styles in clothing G Human wants seem endless Hidden passengers traveling in ships trams or even cars can be a terrible trouble especially when they are insects As for this there is a great between human beings and insects The former every possible effort to avoid being discovered while the latter quickly attention to themselves We can only show mercy to the man who had to slop his car soon after from a country village to drive to London Hearing a strange noise from the of the car he naturally got out to the wheels carefully but he found nothing wrong so he his way Again the noise began and became even louder Quickly his head the man saw what appeared to be a great cloud following the car When he stopped at a village further on he was told that a queen bee must be hidden in his car as there were thousands of bees On learning this the man drove away as quickly as possible After an hour s driving he arrived safely in London where he parked his car outside a and went in It was not long a customer who had seen him arrive in to inform him that his car was with bees The poor driver was that the best way should be to call a In a short time the man arrived He found the unwelcome passenger

the reform and opening up policy carry out our dream came true And then another dream became clearer and clearer in my mind I must try I best to escape out of my poor and backward hometown I worked

Christmas atmosphere B Campbell Remess taught himself how to sew when he was only years old It all started three years ago when Campbell asked his parents if they could buy Christmas presents for kids in hospital They were touched by his kindness but told him that buying so many toys would be too costly He is one of nine children and buying presents for all of them was already a pretty expensive affair for the parents Campbell didn t let a simple no discourage him from bringing a bit of joy to kids going through tough times so he decided to make the presents himself It took the year old boy five hours to create his first stuffed toy However after three years of practice he is now able to put one together in just an hour I was blown away by the first bear his mother said Overly impressed but not surprised at his determination to teach himself The successful experiment only inspired Campbell Remess to become better at sewing and challenged himself to create one stuffed toy per day and dot ate them to sick children struggling in the hospital Project by Campbell was born Over the last three years Campbell Remess has created over stuffed toys for sick children Campbell sends his toys to children all over the world and still visits the Royal Hobart Hospital in his home city of Hobart Tasmania to personally gift toy animals to sick kids there and loves to see the reaction on their faces They smile and some hug me It makes their whole day better he says Campbell is just wired really differently He looks at sadness and tries to turn it upside down his mother says He s not a quitter I only see bigger and brighter things for him Why did Campbell s parents refuse his request A They were on a tight budget B They wished him to depend on himself C They thought that was ridiculous D They hoped he could share his things with others What desire drove Campbell to make toys for sick children A Showing kindness to them B Bringing happiness to them C Encouraging them to treasure health D Proving to them everyone has creativity What can we learn about Campbell from the text A He is planning to set up Project B He is determined and refuses to give up C He made the first toy with his mother s help D He sends toys to those who can t afford one C Kindergarten which means garden for children in German is not kindergarten any more It s yesterday s first grade or even second A study compared kindergarten teachers expectations for their students in to today The differences were striking In percent of teachers thought that kindergarten students should be able to read by the end of the year By that figure is now about percent More than a third kindergarten teachers now think that kids should enter school already knowing the alphabet and how to hold a pencil Besides the researchers found huge decreases in the amount of self directed creative play time dress up art sand and water play and increases in the amount of time students were involved in teacher directed whole class instruction Unfortunately kindergarten today ignores a basic fact of young children s development that is well known by early childhood educators normal development in young children occurs at very different rates and in very different ways For example the average age that a baby starts to walk is months but some kids start walking at eight or nine months and others at or even months Similarly the average age that a child learns to be an independent reader is about six and a half Some learn to read at four and others at seven and both extremes are developmentally normal In the fourth grade kids who learned to read at four are typically not any better at reading than those who started at seven Countries like Finland and Sweden do not even start formal academic schooling until age seven We need to respect children s personal developmental timelines The idea that earlier is better for reading instruction is simply not supported by research evidence Children s long term achievement and self identities as readers and students can be damaged when they are introduced to reading too early What can we infer from the text A Kindergarten has been replaced by first or even second grade B Children should know the alphabet before entering kindergarten C Kindergarten students intelligence has been largely improved D Kindergarten teachers have higher expectations for students now What will probably happen to children who learn to read at A They will perform best among their classmates B They will have difficulty becoming an independent reader C They will fall behind those who learn to read earlier forever D They will catch up with those who learn to read earlier What should kindergarten teachers do according to the text A Increase the time in whole class instruction B Encourage children to learn at their own pace C Pay more attention to children s academic level D Raise children s competitive spirit at an early age How does the author feel about the present education in kindergarten A Ashamed B Cautious C Concerned D Satisfied D Since Torobo a robotic arm designed to test the limits of artificial intelligence has had one ambition to be admitted to the University of Tokyo However it has repeatedly failed This year was no exception In early November Torobo took an exam to prepare for an all important standardized test While Torobo s overall score of out of was points higher than in its standard score of was slightly lower because human students did better in the test Though the score which is higher than the national average is enough to get the robot admitted to many other famous Japanese universities it falls short of the minimum required for the University of Tokyo A closer analysis of the results showed that Torobo s newly programmed ability to solve complex physics problems helped increase its year over year physics score from to The robot also dug deep into its database of information from textbooks and websites to obtain an impressive in world history The average scores acquired in the two math sections were not too shabby either But while Torobo is able to handle knowledge based questions and ones involving complex mathematical calculations it has a hard time thinking independently As a result the robot is unable to comprehend multiple sentences and phrases to arrive at the logical conclusions required in the English language tests This weakness was reflected in the weak oral and writing scores which came in at and respectively Fortunately after four grueling years the robot s creators have decided to free Torobo from its annual test taking suffering The research team will instead focus on improving the robot s ability to pick out specific answers from massive sets of data a skill that led to its excellent history scores They believe the expertise will help Torobo succeed as an industrial robot What is the disadvantage of Torobo A It doesn t own language skills B It couldn t sit through the exams C It has much difficulty searching for facts D It has weak independent thinking ability What does the underlined word grueling in the last paragraph probably mean A happy B successful C tiring D independent What did the exam results show A Torobo did well in the history exam B Torobo was admitted to a university C Torobo s score didn t reach the national average D Torobo s programmed

family He had never been to camp before So Stanley Yelnats seems set to serve an easy sentence which is only fair because he is as innocent as you or me But Stanley is not going where he thinks he is Camp Green Lake is like no other camp anywhere It is a place that has no lake and nothing green Nor is it a camp at least not the kind of camp kids look forward to in the summertime It is only a desert wasteland dotted with countless holes dug by the boys who live at the camp The trouble started when Stanley was accused of stealing a pair of shoes donated by basketball great Clyde Sweetfeet Livingston to a celebrity auction In court the judge doesn t believe Stanley s explanation that the shoes fell from the sky onto his head And yet that s exactly what happened Strangely though Stanley doesn t blame the judge for falsely convicting him Instead he blames the whole thing on his no good dirty rotten pig stealing great great grandfather Thanks to this distant relative the Yelnats family had been cursed for generations For Stanley his current troubles are just a natural part of being a Yelnats At Camp Green Lake the warden makes the boys build character by spending all day every day digging holes five feet wide and five feet deep It doesn t take long for Stanley to realize there s more than character improvement going on at Camp Green Lake The boys are digging holes because the warden is searching for something and before long Stanley begins his own search for the truth Fate is to find a solution to it all the family curse the mystery of the holes The great wheel of justice has ground slowly for generations but now it is about to reveal its verdict Stanley Yelnats went to Camp Green Lake to A serve his sentence B make a choice C enjoy the summertime D show his innocence We can learn from the passage that Stanley A donated the shoes to an auction B blamed the judge for the sentence C stole the shoes for his relative D got the shoes by accident In fact the warden makes the boys dig holes to A break the family curse B look for something C kill the time D build character What does the underlined sentence in Paragraph Three mean A Everyone believes Stanley is born in a

long term effects of such programs the findings suggest that such programs might help children develop long lasting healthy habits This research comes at a time when childhood obesity rates have been rising rapidly More than one third of adolescents in the United States were obese in according to the U S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC This trend has been caused at least in part by a significant decrease in the amount of meals that people consume at home since the s according to background information in the study Cooking education programs such as Food Explorers teach children about new healthy foods and how to prepare them They also stress the importance of eating five fruits and vegetables every day A volunteer parent explains a new food to the group and the kids make something based on the lesson such as fruit or vegetable salad Depending on the program kids may be sent home with information about healthy foods to bring to their parents the review explained The study team reviewed eight other researches that tested different types of cooking education programs Children in these classes were between and years old according to the review The goal of the study team was to learn more about developing an efficient program to encourage healthy food choices that last a lifetime The study found that it is particularly important to expose kids to healthy foods on a number of occasions This makes them feel comfortable with the new foods which helps them build healthy habits The study stressed the importance of getting parents involved in their children s eating habits Parents who are unable to enroll their kids in a cooking class can achieve similar benefits by having their kids help them while they prepare meals at home Children are more comfortable at home which makes them more receptive to new foods because they will make the connection to a positive experience What can we infer from the second paragraph A Childhood obesity rates have been rising rapidly since B Food consumption has decreased significantly since the s C Eating out frequently may cause obesity in some sense D Childhood obesity is totally caused by eating habits In cooking education programs A children may learn information unfamiliar to their parents B children focus more on cooking skills than on information about healthy foods C children learn how to prepare foods

to become obese B Children should eat fruits and vegetables all the time C Parents should let their kids cook independently at home D A greater willingness to try new foods helps building healthy habits Which of the following categories does this passage belong to A Parent child Relationship B Public Health Research C Education Systems D Science and Technology D Loneliness is like a disease and what s worse it s infectious It can spread from one person to another according to the recent research that stresses the power of one person s emotions to affect even people they don t know The new analysis involving people who were interviewed every two years between and showed that a friend of a lonely person was more likely to develop feelings of loneliness by the time of the next interview A friend of that person was more likely and a friend of a friend of a friend was more likely Loneliness is not just the property of an individual It can be transmitted across people even people you don t have direct contact with said John T Cacioppo a psychologist of University of Chicago who led the study published in the December issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology Many factors can lead to loneliness such as depression sleep problems and generally poorer physical health Identifying some of the causes could help reduce the emotion and improve health experts said Although the study did not examine how loneliness spreads Cacioppo said another research has provided clues Let s say for whatever reason you get lonely You then interact with other people in a more negative fashion That puts them in a negative mood and makes them more likely to interact with other people in a negative fashion and they minimize their social ties and become lonely Cacioppo said According to Cacioppo loneliness spread more easily among women than men perhaps because women were more likely to express emotions Lonely people become less and less trusting others This makes it more and more difficult for them to make friends and more likely that society will reject them Therefore it is important to recognize and deal with loneliness Cacioppo emphasizes people who have been pushed to the edges of society should receive help to repair their social networks It can be concluded from the second paragraph that A more and more people are suffering from loneliness B the more friends you make the less lonely you feel C loneliness more likely spreads among close friends D lonely persons are less willing to make friends Which of the following is NOT mentioned in the passage A Loneliness is a social problem B The importance of studying loneliness C Certain causes of loneliness D Loneliness is hard to cure What should lonely people do to get rid of loneliness A

have taken a different role in people s lives therapy dogs Some therapy dogs visit patients in hospitals or nursing homes while others visit children in schools and libraries They are there to help children become better readers Reading programs that use therapy dogs have been in existence for more than ten years All therapy dogs of this program are registered with an organization that tests the dogs to make sure they have the right personality for the job Both the dogs and the handlers are volunteers with the reading program At the start of a reading therapy session a child and a dog are introduced The pair is allowed to settle down in a quiet corner together An adult handler stays nearby but generally lets the dog perform its job without interfering Sometimes a handler may ask a question that encourages the child to work with the dog to help the child feel more comfortable Not every child will be able to be part of a reading therapy program that uses dogs A few children might be allergic to dogs or afraid of them some children might have cultural traditions that prevent them from touching a dog Reading therapy programs inspire learning and change for human beings The readers benefit a lot gaining confidence and learning that reading aloud can be a relaxing experience They spend time with human friends For dogs that love human companionship and a quiet place to rest being part of a reading therapy program can be a great way to spend a few hours being with humans each day A As the child reads the dog usually lies quietly and listens B A dog s handler also

pictures When they receive new pictures the meteorologists compare them with earlier ones Perhaps they may find that the clouds have changed during the last few hours This may mean that the weather on the ground may soon change too In their next weather forecast the meteorologists can say this So the weather satellites are a great help to the meteorologists Before satellites were invented the scientists could forecast the weather for about or hours Now they can make good forecasts for three or five days Soon perhaps they may be able to forecast the weather for a week or more ahead

have a real need That won t be easy I know but we have to start anywhere What s more we can go to work by bike once and twice a week and we can also buy smaller cars that burn less oil Other way is to watch our everyday use of water and electric at home For example how many times have you walked out of a room and leave the lights or television when no one else was there Mrs Wilson Mrs Wilson Tracy

these species are highlighted as global conservation priorities The map reveals that high priority conservation areas for mammals and amphibians are different reflecting the varied evolutionary histories and threats facing the two groups For mammals management efforts are best focused in Southeast Asia southern Africa and Madagascar For amphibians Central and southern America are highlighted as priorities Professor Jonathan Baillie says The results of the mapping exercise are alarming Currently only five percent of the areas we ve identified as priorities for EDGE mammals and percent of the EDGE amphibian areas are protected These areas highlighted should all be global conservation priorities because they contain species that are not only highly threatened but also unique in the way they look live and behave These new maps will inform the development of larger scale work to help secure the future of some of the most remarkable species on Earth Madagascar s black and white ruffed lemur is the largest lemur in the world and is threatened by hunting and the loss of its forest habitat to logging mining and cutting and burning for agriculture The Sunda pangolin occurs in Southeast Asia and is threatened by illegal hunting for its meat as well as its scales which are thought to have high medicinal value Other mammal species occurring in priority areas include the black rhino and western lowland gorilla Amphibians are facing a terrifying rate of extinction making them the most threatened animals in the world The Mexican salamander is critically endangered due to urbanization polluted waters and the introduction of non native fish which eat the axolotl s young With the aid of the global map of EDGE amphibians it will now be possible to concentrate efforts in countries such as Mexico Costa Rica and Guatemala where the most distinct and threatened species are found Professor Jonathan Baillie says This is the first global map to take into account species uniqueness as well as threat Now that we ve identified EDGE priority areas for mammals and amphibians we can more effectively continue to ensure their protection Which of the following can be the best title for the

can be known from the passage that A conservation areas for mammals and amphibians are almost the same B human activities are the largest threat to mammals and amphibians C the global map of EDGE amphibians does no good to threatened species D scientists still need more researches to establish EDGE priority areas Life rules the series UP tells us Life goes on Through the years we ve seen the participants experience deaths divorce and dramatic career setbacks We ve also seen them walk out from adversity Over and over we ve seen the participants believe negative events meant their lives were finished But people will gradually return to their personal baseline of happiness after a triumph or a tragedy Count your blessings Neil for example suffers severe mental illness and has been homeless and suicidal for long stretches of time But Neil also provides the audience with many moments of grace as when he recounts how grateful he is for long walks and conversations with friends This sense of gratitude contributes powerfully to the resilience self cure of Neil People who live a life of thankfulness really do experience life differently than people who cheat themselves out of life by not feeling grateful At for people who put energy into families there was a big payback said Michael Apted Again and again the Up series reveals how important friends family and social connections are to an individual s success and happiness in life For both men and women caring for others invested their lives with a meaning that they weren t able to find in any other activity The series does in fact show that money matters But the research also shows that once we secure food shelter and a minimum level of comfort happiness springs from life meaning and relationships much more

schoolmaster D Children with clever and intelligent parents do better than others C There s nothing like a wagging tail to cheer you up after a bad day Science even shows that dogs may reduce feelings of anxiety and loneliness But our furry friends don t only contribute to our good moods they might even be able to recognize them New research shows that dogs may be able to tell when we re happy just by looking at our faces The study published in the journal Current Biology rewarded a group of dogs for recognizing both happy and angry faces Each dog was individually shown only the eyes the mouths or the left half of the faces of smiling and angry humans One group of animals saw the same faces they were trained with and the others were given new faces to look at during the test In the study scientists rewarded half of the dogs for recognizing happy faces and the other half for recognizing angry ones In their results the scientists saw one main trend The dogs who were rewarded for the smiling faces learned to distinguish between the two feelings faster than the ones that were rewarded for frowning faces The paper points out that we d expect these outcomes if the dogs had been punished when shown the angry faces but they were actually rewarded for both frowning and smiling faces The bottom line The results of the study may be a sign that dogs not only notice a difference in our facial expressions but might even understand them to a certain extent So next time you see your dog wagging his tail go ahead and smile back What does the word them in Paragraph refer to A anxiety and loneliness B dogs owners C dogs D our good moods Why are a group of dogs rewarded according to the study published in Current Biology A They can wag their tails B They can make their owners happy C They can recognize both happy and angry faces D They can remember the shown eyes and mouths What is the passage mainly about A Our dogs know when we re happy B During the test all the dogs were given new faces to look at C The dogs rewarded for the frowning faces learned to distinguish the two feelings faster D The results of the study prove that dogs understand our facial expressions to a certain extent D SAN FRANCISCO AP Samsung says new Galaxy Note smartphones will be available in U S stores starting Wednesday to replace about million devices that are being recalled because their

where Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered EDGE mammals and amphibians occur Regions containing the highest concentrations of these species are highlighted as global conservation priorities The map reveals that high priority conservation areas for mammals and amphibians are different reflecting the varied evolutionary histories and threats facing the two groups For mammals management efforts are best focused in Southeast Asia southern Africa and Madagascar For amphibians Central and southern America are highlighted as priorities Professor Jonathan Baillie says The results of the mapping exercise are alarming Currently only five percent of the areas we ve identified as priorities for EDGE mammals and percent of the EDGE amphibian areas are protected These areas highlighted should all be global conservation priorities because they contain species that are not only highly threatened but also unique in the way they look live and behave These new maps will inform the development of larger scale work to help secure the future of some of the most remarkable species on Earth Madagascar s black and white ruffed lemur is the largest lemur in the world and is threatened by hunting and the loss of its forest habitat to logging mining and cutting and burning for agriculture The Sunda pangolin occurs in Southeast Asia and is threatened by illegal hunting for its meat as well as its scales which are thought to have high medicinal value Other mammal species occurring in priority areas include the black rhino and western lowland gorilla Amphibians are facing a terrifying rate of extinction making them the most threatened animals in the world The Mexican salamander is critically endangered due to urbanization polluted waters and the introduction of non native fish which eat the axolotl s young With the aid of the global map of EDGE amphibians it will now be possible to concentrate efforts in countries such as Mexico Costa Rica and Guatemala where the most distinct and threatened species are found Professor Jonathan Baillie says This is the first global map to take into account species uniqueness as well as threat Now that we ve identified EDGE priority areas for mammals and amphibians we can more effectively continue to ensure their protection Which of the following can be the best title for the passage A Most mammals and amphibians in the world become extinct B Conservation areas should be set up in more and more areas C World s most extraordinary species mapped for the first time D The most rare and threatened animals in the world

conservation areas for mammals and amphibians are almost the same B human activities are the largest threat to mammals and amphibians C the global map of EDGE amphibians does no good to threatened species D scientists still need more researches to establish EDGE priority areas Life rules the series UP tells us Life goes on Through the years we ve seen the participants experience deaths divorce and dramatic career setbacks We ve also seen them walk out from adversity Over and over we ve seen the participants believe negative events meant their lives were finished But people will gradually return to their personal baseline of happiness after a triumph or a tragedy Count your blessings Neil for example suffers severe mental illness and has been homeless and suicidal for long stretches of time But Neil also provides the audience with many moments of grace as when he recounts how grateful he is for long walks and conversations with friends This sense of gratitude contributes powerfully to the resilience self cure of Neil People who live a life of thankfulness really do experience life differently than people who cheat themselves out of life by not feeling grateful At for people who put energy into families there was a big payback said Michael Apted Again and again the Up series reveals how important friends family and social connections are to an individual s success and happiness in life For both men and women caring for others invested their lives with a meaning that they weren t able to find in any other activity The series does in fact show that money matters But the research also shows that once we secure food shelter and a minimum level of comfort happiness springs from life meaning and relationships much more than money Don t compare yourself to others Yes

about Yours Li Hu A B C D A I Went Skydiving at As a young girl growing up in the s I always wanted to fly a plane but back then it was almost unheard of for a woman to do that I got a taste of the dream in when my husband arranged for me to ride in a hot air balloon for my birthday But the experience turned out to be very dull Around that time I told my husband that I wanted to skydive So when our retirement community announced that they were having an essay competition and the topic was an experience of a lifetime that you wanted to have I decided to write about my dream In the essay I wrote about my desire to skydive stating Gorge Bush Sr did it at age Why not me I was just and in pretty good health A year went by and I heard nothing But then at a community party in late April they announced that I was one of the winners I just couldn t believe it Inspired by this I decided to realize my dream even though some of my family members and my doctor were against it On June nearly of my family and friends gathered in the area close to where I would land while I headed up in the airplane My instructor Jay guided me through the experience The plane was the noisiest one I had ever been in but I wasn t frightened I was really just looking forward to the experience When we reached feet Jay instructed me to throw myself out of the plane When we first hit the air the wind was so strong that I could hardly breathe For a second I thought What have I gotten myself into But then everything got calmer We were in a free fall for about a minute before Jay opened the parachute then we just floated downward for about five minutes Being up in the clouds and looking at the view below was unlike anything I have ever felt much better than the hot air balloon I was just enjoying it Skydiving was really one of the greatest experiences of my life I hope other people will look at me and really one of the greatest experiences of my life I hope other people will look at me and realize that you don t stop living just because you are years old If there s something you want to experience look into it If it s something that is possible make it happen What happened to the author in A She flew an airplane B She entered a competition C She went on a hot air balloon ride D She moved into a retirement community The author mentioned George Bush Sr in the essay to A build up her own reputation B show her admiration for him C compare their health condition D make her argument persuasive How did the author feel immediately after she jumped out of the plane A Excited B Scared C Nervous D Regretful What did the author enjoy most when she was skydiving A The beautiful clouds B The wonderful view C The company of Jay D The one minute free fall B Students and Technology in the Classroom I love my Blackberry it s my little connection to the larger world that can go anywhere with me I also love my laptop computer as it holds all of my writing and thoughts Despite this love of technology I know that there are times when I need to move away from there devices and truly communicate with others On occasion I teach a course called History Matters for a group of higher education managers My goals for the class include a full discussion of historical themes and ideas Because I want students to thoroughly study the material and exchange their ideas with each other in the classroom I have a rule no laptops iPads etc When students were told my rule in advance of the class some of them were not happy Most students assume that my reasons for this rule include unpleasant experiences in the past with students misusing technology There s a bit of truth to that Some students assume that I am anti technology There s no truth in that at all I love technology and try to keep up with it so I can relate to my students The real reason why I ask students to leave technology at the door is that I think there are very few places in which we can have deep conversations and truly engage complex ideas Interruptions by technology often break concentration and allow for too much dependence on out information for ideas I want students to dig deep within themselves for inspiration and ideas I want them to push each other to think differently and to make connections between the course material and the class discussion I ve been teaching my history class in this way for many years and the evaluations reflect student satisfaction with the environment that I create Students realize that with deep conversation and challenge they learn at a level that helps them keep the course material beyond the classroom I m not saying that I won t ever change my mind about technology use in my history class but until I hear a really good reason for the change I m sticking to my plan A few hours of technology free dialogue is just too sweet to give up Some of the students in the history class were unhappy with A the course material B others misuse of technology C discussion topics D the author s class regulations The underlined word engage in Para probably means A explore B accept C change D reject According to the author the use of technology in the classroom may A keep students from doing independent thinking B encourage students to have in depth conversations C help students to better understand complex themes D affect students concentration on course evaluation It can be inferred from the last paragraph that the author A is quite stubborn B will give up teaching history C will change his teaching plan soon D values technology free dialogues in his class C Have a nice day may be a pleasant gesture or a meaningless expression When my friend Maxie says Have a nice day with a smile I know she sincerely cares about what happens to me I feel loved and secure since another person cares about me and wishes me well Have a nice day Next The version of the expression is spoken by a salesgirl at supermarket who is rushing me and my groceries out the door The words came out in the same tone with a fixed procedure They are spoken at me not to me Obviously the concern for my day and everyone else s is the management s attempt to increase business The expression is one of those behaviors that help people get along with each other Sometimes it indicates the end of a meeting As soon as you hear it you know the meeting at an end Sometimes the expression saves us when we don t know what to say Oh you just had a tooth out I m terribly sorry but have a nice day The expression can be pleasant If a stranger says Have a nice day to you you may find it heart warming because someone you don t know has tried to be nice to you Although the use of the expression is insincere meaningless social custom at times there is nothing wrong with the sentence except that it is a little uninteresting The salesgirl the waitress the teacher and the countless others who speak it without thinking may not really care about my day But in a strange and comfortable way it s nice to know they care enough to pretend they care when they really don t care all that much While the expression may not often be sincere it is always spoken The point is that people say it all the time when they like How does the author understand Maxie s words A Maxie shows her anxiety to the author B Maxie really wishes the author a good day C Maxie encourages the author to stay happy D Maxie really worries about the author s security What does the underlined sentence in Paragraph mean A The salesgirl is rude B The salesgirl is bored C The salesgirl cares about me D The salesgirl says the words as a routine By saying Have a nice day a stranger may A try to be polite to you B express respect to you C give his blessing to you D share his pleasure with you According to the last paragraph people say Have a nice day A sincerely B as thanks C as a habit D encouragingly D I was blind but I was ashamed of it if it was known I refused to use a white stick and hated asking for help After all I was a teenage girl and I couldn t bear people to look at me and think I was not like them I must have been a terrible danger on the roads Coming across me wandering through the traffic motorists probably would have to step rapidly on their brakes Apart from that there were all sorts of disasters that used to occur on the way to and from work One evening I got off the bus about halfway home where I had to change buses and as usual I ran into something I m awfully sorry I said and stepped forward only to run into it again When it happened a third time I realized I had been apologizing to a lamppost This was just one of the stupid things that constantly happened to me So I carried on and found the bus stop which was a request stop where the bus wouldn t stop unless passengers wanted to get on or off No one else was there and I had to try to guess if the bus had arrived Generally in this situation because I hated showing I was blind by asking for help I tried to guess at the sound Sometimes I would stop a big lorry and stand there feeling stupid as it drew away In the end I usually managed to swallow my pride and ask someone at the stop for help But on this particular evening no one joined me at the stop It seemed that everyone had suddenly decided not to travel by bus Of course I heard plenty of buses pass or I thought I did But because I had given up stopping them for fear of making a fool of myself I let them all go by I stood there alone for half an hour without stopping one Then I gave up I decided to walk on to the next stop The girl refused to ask for help because she thought A she might be recognized B asking for help looked silly C she was normal and independent D being fond blind was embarrassing After the girl got off the bus that evening she A began to run B hit a person as usual C hit a lamppost by accident D was caught by something At the request stop that evening the girl A stopped a big lorry B stopped the wrong bus C made no attempt to stop the bus D was not noticed by other people How to Make Friends Friendship is a very important human relationship and everyone needs good friends Good friendship has many benefits It

two primary concerns in coffee growth and farmers are stuck between a rock and a hard place We know that coffee grows in a certain temperature range Nelson says They ve been moving up the mountains but at some paint you run out of mountains to move up Higher grade strains of Arabica coffee in Central American regions are at particular risk due to the need for lower growing temperature especially since diseases and pests are also becoming more of a factor as temperatures rise Even if you re looking at the direct effects of temperature alone rice is in trouble As nighttime temperatures go up the rice is going to have a problem flowering and won t make as many seeds Nelson says In addition to this direct heat consequence rising sea levels will flood many rice fields and destroy water

The Real Reason For Crops Growth D Three Crops That Won t Survive Minor Climate Changes D Before you walked down the aisle if you even did did you first agree to take your partner s name Had you agreed to the bank for updated credit cards changed your email address and updated your Facebook I didn t and I know plenty of women out there didn t either So I was pretty shocked to learn that in a recent survey over percent of U S citizens believe a wife should take her husband s name and she should be required to do so by law Author Emily Schafer a sociology professor at Portland State University surveyed a representative national sample of people tar the study which found that a larger number of American adults think there needs to actually be a law in place to prevent women from keeping their own name The most common reason given The general belief is that women should prioritize their marriage and their family ahead of themselves To this I admit I m a bit confused because I don t understand how exactly riot taking your husband s last name means you aren t prioritizing your marriage Now I didn t take my husband s name for a variety of reasons I didn t feel like the name was mine and professionally I had built up a reputation as a writer under my maiden name so I didn t want to lose that His surname wasn t easy to spell either everyone gets it wrong including my mother still and we ve been married years But most of all I felt like in taking my husband s last name I was losing a huge sense of self And while yes we are a family I don t want his surname to define me I m not his possession Just like every aspect of motherhood each woman should be respected for the choices she makes without having to do anything by law And we should all be grateful to Lucy Stone the first American woman to legally maintain her last name after marriage in Just imagine how difficult that must have been to forego tradition in that time What can be learned about the tradition of taking a husband s name from the survey A A law should be there to break the tradition B The majority of American adults support the tradition C The majority of American women go against the tradition D The law requires wives to take their husbands names in America Why does an American woman generally take her husband s name A To value her marriage and family B To show honesty to her husband C To join in the family of her husband D To unite a new family under the same name What can we learn from Paragraph A Why the author didn t use her husband s name B Why the author s mother didn t like her husband C How worthy the author s own maiden name was D How bored the author became with her husband s name What s the author s attitude towards the tradition A It s reasonable B It needs no care C Every coin has two sides D It s out of date and confusing E A B F C D G B C Four Questions to Ask Before Choosing a Travel Agent While online booking engines have made it easier for travelers to buy their own flights or hotel rooms travel agents still offer a level of service Have you visited my destination Whether you re traveling to Paris or Puerto Rico ask if your agent has been there But they don t always measure up to being there in person Book knowledge or online training seminars by suppliers is totally different from experiencing it firsthand Flagg says What Is your response time If waiting several days for a response to an emailed question is going to make you anxious ask potential agents when they re available and how quickly you should expect a response Some agents are part time agents and they work in the evenings Griswold says Others do this full time It s definitely smart to find out if your schedule can adjust with what your agent can provide Agents provide varying levels of service Some will only book hotels and flights and leave you to fill in the other details so if you re expecting help with dinner reservations or ground transportation ask if he can handle those A good agent is going to help you with any details that you want Griswold says What fees should I expect Some agents charge a flat lee or an hourly fee for travel consulting while others earn commission from the airline or hotel booked Griswold says A What services do you offer B How do you find a right service C Some are available during the school day D Guidebooks and websites offer lots of advertisements E Ask about fees whether there are booking fees or any other fee F Guidebooks and websites offer lots of detail on a given destination G Here are some questions

family He had never been to camp before So Stanley Yelnats seems set to serve an easy sentence which is only fair because he is as innocent as you or me But Stanley is not going where he thinks he is Camp Green Lake is like no other camp anywhere It is a place that has no lake and nothing green Nor is it a camp at least not the kind of camp kids look forward to in the summertime It is only a desert wasteland dotted with countless holes dug by the boys who live at the camp The trouble started when Stanley was accused of stealing a pair of shoes donated by basketball great Clyde Sweetfeet Livingston to a celebrity auction In court the judge doesn t believe Stanley s explanation that the shoes fell from the sky onto his head And yet that s exactly what happened Strangely though Stanley doesn t blame the judge for falsely convicting him Instead he blames the whole thing on his no good dirty rotten pig stealing great great grandfather Thanks to this distant relative the Yelnats family had been cursed for generations For Stanley his current troubles are just a natural part of being a Yelnats At Camp Green Lake the warden makes the boys build character by spending all day every day digging holes five feet wide and five feet deep It doesn t take long for Stanley to realize there s more than character improvement going on at Camp Green Lake The boys are digging holes because the warden is searching for something and before long Stanley begins his own search for the truth Fate is to find a solution to it all the family curse the mystery of the holes The great wheel of justice has ground slowly for generations but now it is about to reveal its verdict Stanley Yelnats went to Camp Green Lake to A serve his sentence B make a choice C enjoy the summertime D show his innocence We can learn from the passage that Stanley A donated the shoes to an auction B blamed the judge for the sentence C stole the shoes for his relative D got the shoes by accident In fact the warden makes the boys dig holes to A break the family curse B look for something C kill the time D build character What does the underlined sentence in Paragraph Three mean A Everyone believes Stanley is born in a

long term effects of such programs the findings suggest that such programs might help children develop long lasting healthy habits This research comes at a time when childhood obesity rates have been rising rapidly More than one third of adolescents in the United States were obese in according to the U S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC This trend has been caused at least in part by a significant decrease in the amount of meals that people consume at home since the s according to background information in the study Cooking education programs such as Food Explorers teach children about new healthy foods and how to prepare them They also stress the importance of eating five fruits and vegetables every day A volunteer parent explains a new food to the group and the kids make something based on the lesson such as fruit or vegetable salad Depending on the program kids may be sent home with information about healthy foods to bring to their parents the review explained The study team reviewed eight other researches that tested different types of cooking education programs Children in these classes were between and years old according to the review The goal of the study team was to learn more about developing an efficient program to encourage healthy food choices that last a lifetime The study found that it is particularly important to expose kids to healthy foods on a number of occasions This makes them feel comfortable with the new foods which helps them build healthy habits The study stressed the importance of getting parents involved in their children s eating habits Parents who are unable to enroll their kids in a cooking class can achieve similar benefits by having their kids help them while they prepare meals at home Children are more comfortable at home which makes them more receptive to new foods because they will make the connection to a positive experience What can we infer from the second paragraph A Childhood obesity rates have been rising rapidly since B Food consumption has decreased significantly since the s C Eating out frequently may cause obesity in some sense D Childhood obesity is totally caused by eating habits In cooking education programs A children may learn information unfamiliar to their parents B children focus more on cooking skills than on information about healthy foods C children learn how to prepare foods

habits Which of the following categories does this passage belong to A Parent child Relationship B Public Health Research C Education Systems D Science and Technology D Loneliness is like a disease and what s worse it s infectious It can spread from one person to another according to the recent research that stresses the power of one person s emotions to affect even people they don t know The new analysis involving people who were interviewed every two years between and showed that a friend of a lonely person was more likely to develop feelings of loneliness by the time of the next interview A friend of that person was more likely and a friend of a friend of a friend was more likely Loneliness is not just the property of an individual It can be transmitted across people even people you don t have direct contact with said John T Cacioppo a psychologist of University of Chicago who led the study published in the December issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology Many factors can lead to loneliness such as depression sleep problems and generally poorer physical health Identifying some of the causes could help reduce the emotion and improve health experts said Although the study did not examine how loneliness spreads Cacioppo said another research has provided clues Let s say for whatever reason you get lonely You then interact with other people in a more negative fashion That puts them in a negative mood and makes them more likely to interact with other people in a negative fashion and they minimize their social ties and become lonely Cacioppo said According to Cacioppo loneliness spread more easily among women than men perhaps because women were more likely to express emotions Lonely people become less and less trusting others This makes it more and more difficult for them to make friends and more likely that society will reject them Therefore it is important to recognize and deal with loneliness Cacioppo emphasizes people who have been pushed to the edges of society should receive help to repair their social networks It can be concluded from the second paragraph that A more and more people are suffering from loneliness B the more friends you make the less lonely you feel C loneliness more likely spreads among close friends D lonely persons are less willing to make friends Which of the following is NOT mentioned in

introduced The pair is allowed to settle down in a quiet corner together An adult handler stays nearby but generally lets the dog perform its job without interfering Sometimes a handler may ask a question that encourages the child to work with the dog to help the child feel more comfortable Not every child will be able to be part of a reading therapy program that uses dogs A few children might be allergic to dogs or afraid of them some children might have cultural traditions that prevent them from touching a dog Reading therapy programs inspire learning and change for human beings The readers benefit a lot gaining confidence and learning that reading aloud can be a relaxing experience They spend time with human friends For dogs that love human companionship and a quiet place to

get it done One night she worked until midnight doing homework I felt annoyed but I didn t want the teacher to think I was lazy so I never complained I wasn t sure but it seemed to me that five hours of homework was a bit too much for a fifth grade student Later I found out that parents and educators have discussed about homework for more than a century Parents who like more homework want to give their children every advantage to succeed in today s world Some educators see homework as a way to help students perform better in tests Other parents dislike the recent trend toward more homework They don t want to stay up until midnight helping their children They would prefer to spend their time going to the park or reading some really good books with their children Added to the opposition are those who say that homework increases the gap between the rich and the poor since middle class families do better when it comes to helping their children with their homework So who is right Is homework an enemy or a help According to experts the truth lies somewhere in the middle The author thought that her daughter s homework A was too difficult B was too much to finish C was done more carefully than her classmates D could be done as long as she studied harder The author never complained to the teacher because A she was too angry to talk with the teacher B she did not like complaining at all C she was afraid of being thought lazy by the teacher D her daughter would be annoyed if she complained Some parents support the idea of giving more homework to children because A they want to develop a good relationship with their children s teachers B they think it a good way to keep their children from spending all their time on the Internet C they want to teach their children by themselves at home D they believe more homework will help children succeed in today s society What does the underlined sentence in the last paragraph probably mean A Experts think middle school students should do lots of homework B Experts haven t come up with any idea to solve this problem C Experts think homework should be given but not too much D Experts support the idea that homework is good for students D India is a developing country It has thousands of years of tradition and culture Different types of people live in India In the old days the educational institutions

television telephone radio computer Internet and mobile phones is very strong in everyday life But even today teachers are role models for students Teaching is still a respectable job But there are great changes in the education system One of the most obvious changes is that the influence of Western culture has increased We are paying too much attention to doing business just like the Western world Teachers are likely to to be influenced by this too but it is not good Teachers are nation builders The development of any country depends upon its education system All types of development are possible through education Another change has happened in the curriculum The curriculum connects the teacher and the student While education is about learning curriculum means the situations in which one learns When we say that education deals with what then curriculum deals with how and when But at the moment it is hard to say whether the curriculum is playing such a role In India an ashramam was

hours of homework It was my duty to help her get it done One night she worked until midnight doing homework I felt annoyed but I didn t want the teacher to think I was lazy so I never complained I wasn t sure but it seemed to me that five hours of homework was a bit too much for a fifth grade student Later I found out that parents and educators have discussed about homework for more than a century Parents who like more homework want to give their children every advantage to succeed in today s world Some educators see homework as a way to help students perform better in tests Other parents dislike the recent trend toward more homework They don t want to stay up until midnight helping their children They would prefer to spend their time going to the park or reading some really good books with their children Added to the opposition are those who say that homework increases the gap between the rich and the poor since middle class families do better when it comes to helping their children with their homework So who is right Is homework an enemy or a help According to experts the truth lies somewhere in the middle The author thought that her daughter s homework A was too difficult B was too much to finish C was done more carefully than her classmates D could be done as long as she studied harder The author never complained to the teacher because A she was too angry to talk with the teacher B she did not like complaining at all C she was afraid of being thought lazy by the teacher D her daughter would be annoyed if she complained Some parents support the idea of giving more homework to children because A they want to develop a good relationship with their children s teachers B they think it a good way to keep their children from spending all their time on the

surrounded by friends and relatives and if they are able to express their feelings they are more likely to recover from their grief No man is an island In other words we are all parts of society We

older people aims to promote activity and deal with loneliness by urging them to take part in digital and physical activities The ElliQ robot made by Israel based start up Intuition Robotics will be published at the Design Museum in London this week ElliQ is a small desktop device that consists of a domed body and a separate detachable screen Created in collaboration with Swiss designer Yves Behar the robot is able to encourage a degree of social engagement Similar to home assistants like the Amazon Echo people can simply talk to it and there are visual clues that could be particularly helpful for those with hearing difficulties A key purpose of ElliQ is to act as an easy platform to access existing services such as social media and messaging programs For example the device could alert the users that their grandchild has posted a new photo on Facebook show it to them on the screen ElliQ can recommend activities voluntarily It might ask if you re interested in watching a video for instance or suggest a walk It can also act as reminder to take medication Having a robot constantly offer suggestions could obviously get annoying so the device uses machine learning to tailor these suggestions to individual preferences If a suggestion is met with a positive response once ElliQ might try it again If not it might change for a different tack Which of the following statements is NOT true A robot companion for older people will strongly advise them to participate in digital and physical activities to be healthy B The screen of the ElliQ robot can be removed if necessary C The ElliQ robot is published at the Design Museum in London D The ElliQ robot is created by Swiss designer Yves Behar and Israel based start up Intuition Robotics The underlined word alert is closest

and may go on with a life of crime if their behavior isn t challenged scientists have discovered While most children grow out of their bad behavior by adulthood a study found those who had callous unemotional characteristics could grow up to have problems with the law later in life Behavior characteristics such as a lack of sympathy and lying in childhood could have an impact years on Luke Hyde assistant professor of psychology at the University of Michigan said These are signs for parents and doctors to watch out for as they may signal more than just the terrible twos He said Parents both take care of their child and provide their child s genes so it s been difficult to know if we re seeing that parenting causes callous unemotional behaviors or if it is just a sign of the genes being passed to the child The research also discovered that strict parenting is linked to the development of antisocial behavior Scientists looked at families in an adoption study that examined biological mothers antisocial behavior The scientists found children of antisocial mothers were also more likely to exhibit the same behavior characteristics despite having limited or no touch with them as they were adopted as babies The really exciting take home message from this study is that small day to day positive interactions that parents have with their young children can make a huge difference in children s development said Leslie Leve a professor at the University of Oregon who co led the data collection Even when children have inherited a very challenging set of behaviors hearing good job or receiving encouragement can help protect them from developing serious problems coming from their inherited difficulties he added The study worked on by scientists from the University of Michigan Penn State University and the University of Oregon has been published in the American Journal of Psychiatry Researchers will follow the group of children through early adolescence to determine if these behaviors still continue to exist from the toddler years What s the main idea of the passage A Kids social behaviors are related to crime B Criminals begin their crimes during adolescence C Warmhearted kids are more likely to be criminals in the future D Antisocial behaviors of kids could be on their way to a life of crime What conclusion might the scientists draw from the study A Antisocial behaviors might be inherited B The genes decide kids antisocial behaviors C Antisocial behaviors have noting to do with crimes D Adopted babies surely have antisocial behaviors when they grow up What can be inferred from the passage A Parenting is the main reason that causes kids antisocial behaviors B What causes career criminals to begin their crimes is their parents characteristics C Inherited antisocial behaviors of kids can be lightened by positive parenting D Leslie Leve has a doubtful attitude to adoptive mothers active interactions with kids Why will researchers track kids process of growing A To make sure if praise will change kids B To make sure if kids behaviors will last C To determine if kids behaviors will be inherited D To determine if parents comfort will protect kids E Since the day of its birth the United Nations has been the subject of much debate Others think that it is too weak We can better understand this debate if we learn more about the U N and its history The U N was started for two reasons First when the idea was born people all over the world were tired of war They felt that there must be peaceful answers to the world s problems The second reason was that modern science had developed new bombs and airplanes National borders were beginning to lose their meaning Science would develop even more dangerous weapons in the future Only an international organization would be able to control modern science Franklin D Roosevelt U S President at the time believed that the Allies should plan for peace before the war ended On December Roosevelt Britain s Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin from Soviet Union agreed to start an organization for world peace During the next year and a half the idea of such an organisation was debated around the world Then came the big day On April the first international meeting of the United Nations took place in San Francisco The goal of the meeting was to write the U N Charter All of the fifty

Before the interview he had made full preparations for everything needed He dressed himself decently and behaved properly in the interview leave a favorable impression on the interviewer Expectedly Jim inform that he got the job eventually Remember Sometimes your appearance is a mirror reflects your quality in a way Also your state of mind counts People with positive attitude are more likely succeed than with negative attitude As is often the case when people are attending to meetings having meals or waiting for buses you can always find them addicting to their phones completely ignoring others This is really a common phenomena in our life The reason is why smart phones nowadays can be used for people to play mobile games and kept in touch with friends through QQ and WeChat Therefore too much exposure to phones are bad for people in terms of health Moreover people involved in phones fail to communicate well with these around them As far as I am concerned people should wisely make

the audience a photographic record touching upon the uncivilized life continues Gin I prefer to work in black and white which allows me to show different specific worlds more clearly His black and

study by researchers from Seoul South Korea involved mice being fed with dried milk powder made from cows milked both during the day and at night Those given night milk which contained times the amount of melatonin were less active and less anxious than those fed with the milk collected during daytime according to the study published in The Journal of Medicinal Food Night milk quickened the start of sleep and caused the mice to sleep longer While the effect of cows milk harvested at different time has not been tested on humans up to now taking melatonin drugs has been suggested to those who are struggling to fall asleep at night Previous studies have also indicated that milk can be excellent for helping sleep because of the calcium content which helps people to relax Milk is also

about and women produce hormones that are involved in fertility These hormones also have a positive effect on the heart and blood flow In fact women are less likely to have high blood pressure or to die from heart attacks They help the body defend itself against some kinds of infections This means that women generally ger sick less often and less seriously than men The common cold is a good example women on average get fewer colds than men Scientists are still not exactly sure how influence aging but they believe that they do Some think that a woman s body cells have a tendency to age

after talking to a friend who had indicated that the s had been pretty rough for Marci So meeting her at the baseball game was really out of expectation We spent a few minutes talking about our lives the good old bad old days Then Marci grew quiet for a moment You know Joe she said I ve always wanted to tell you how how sorry I am for the way I treated you You must have been hurt both physically and mentally I was a little embarrassed I turned and looked at her It s OK I said No big deal But I was such a jerk she continued Yes you were I thought We were both pretty young I smiled I know she said It s just always bothered me remembering how mean I was to you And I ve wanted to tell you that I m sorry The expression on her face was warm and sincere And there was something in her eyes it looked a lot like relief OK I said Apology accepted Overcome by the sweetness of the moment I reached an arm around her and gave her a quick hug Just then the crowd erupted with a huge cheer and Marci and I both returned our attention to the game By the time I looked over to where she had been she was gone But the warm wonderful feeling of our brief exchange was still there and continues to this

hot red chili peppers might reduce death risk say Chopan and Littenberg from the research team In hot peppers such as Mexico peppers the strong flavor comes from a compound which does not exist in sweet peppers or onions Studies have suggested that this compound can offer a wealth of health benefits A study of more than people in the United States revealed that individuals who consumed red chili peppers had a lower risk of death from all causes over an average of years than those who did not eat the spicy food Compared with participants who did not consume hot red chili peppers those who did were found to be at percent reduced risk of all cause death For example a recent study reported by Medical News Today found that the compound might have the potential to stop breast cancer while an earlier study linked the compound to a reduced risk of digest system cancers Still the available data suggested that hot red chili pepper consumption was most strongly associated with a reduced risk of death from heart disease While the researchers are unable to identify the concrete compound by which red chili peppers might extend lifespan the team says that it is likely due to the compound that is effectively against obesity Overall the team says that these latest findings support those of the study linking spicy food intake to reduced risk of death by showing a significant decrease in death associated with hot red chili pepper consumption However Chopan and Littenberg note that the earlier study was only conducted in Chinese adults so the new research makes these findings more credible What can be inferred from the passage A The study only goes for American people B Red chili pepper can cure all cause disease C The compound protects people against obesity D Onion consuming can reduce death risk What is the finding of the new research mainly about A Hot red chili pepper lovers develop no cancers B Hot red chili peppers help control breast illness C Hot red chili peppers decrease heart disease D Hot red chili pepper intake may increase lifespan Which of the following has the closest meaning to the underlined word credible A Convincing B Practical C Encouraging D Attractive D When you re working your way through one of life s storms it is human nature to focus on getting back to normal to bounce back as quickly as possible to a place where things are calm familiar and comfortable However actually it is unrealistic to think we can ever truly return emotionally and intelligently to where we were before the storm because every experience changes us in some way For example when we experience a major health scare possibly involving some hospital time we can never go back to being the person we were before the event even if we fully recover because we have experienced firsthand the fragility of life not to mention coming face to face with death So now that we can never return what should we do Consider this how is it that two people can be faced with the same hardship and while one becomes hopeless and feels anger and upset the other is able to overcome their circumstances and grow stronger than ever as a result of the experience At one extreme we may choose to accept the role of unlucky victim or become trapped in the Why is it always me negative and frustrating situations Either way is the result of a fixed mindset that is resistant to growth and change If this is your approach to life you will be far less likely to be active in effectively managing change and recovering from bad situations But there is another choice If you are honest enough you may consider what was once normal for you was just the main cause of your storm You can choose to hug change and uncertainty and learn to grow forward through all of your experiences Of course this means doing the work to develop the skills and habits that will enable you to handle life s occasional storms In conclusion it is up to each of us to choose the meaning we apply to our situations at all times Different choices will lead to different lives Of course you can grow forward if you are determined to choose to live a positive life regardless of whatever hardships you are facing What does the author try to convey with the example in the second paragraph A We will understand life much better after an escape from death B It usually takes a long time to recover from a health problem C It s unlikely to return to where we were after certain events D We can recover from an emotional problem much more easily When faced with hardships some people choose to be a victim because of A their terrible experiences B their negative thoughts C their poor health D their bad luck What is the author s purpose in writing the text A To advise us to manage bad emotions B To persuade us to get back to normal C To offer us useful skills to work with D To encourage us to overcome hardships If you re determined to grow forward you have to A experience life s fragility B welcome uncertainty and change C develop new skills and habits D overcome the fear of death E F G E AB F AC G AD If you are hungry what do you do Have your favorite meal and stay quiet after that But It never lets you know because you keep it busy thinking about your friends or favorite stars So it silently serves your needs and never lets itself grow When mind loses its freedom to grow creativity gets a full stop This might be the reason why we all sometimes think What happens next Why can t I think Why reading but not watching TV It is because reading has been the most

it s mostly for show In reality it the chair that does the important work When a lion tamer holds a chair n front of the lion s face the lion tries to focus on all four legs of the chair at the same time With its focus divided the lion becomes confused and is unsure about what to do next When faced with so many options the lion chooses to freeze and wait instead of attacking the man holding the chair How often do you find yourself in the same position as the lion How often do you have something you want to achieve e g lose weight start a business travel more only to end up confused by all of the options in front of you and never make progress This upsets me to no end because while all the experts are busy debating about which option is been the people who want to improve their lives are

the same when we could be improving It doesn t have to be that way Anytime you find the world waving a chair in your face remember this All you need to do is focus on one thing You just need to get started Starting before you feel ready is one of the habits of successful people If you have somewhere you want to go something you want to accomplish someone you want to become take immediate action

advantage of Apple Day to see what s around It s called Apple Day but in practice it s more like Apple Month The day itself is on October but since it has caught on events now spread out over most of October around Britain Visiting an apple event is a good chance to see and often taste a wide variety of apples To people who are used to the limited choice of apples such as Golden Delicious and Royal Gala in supermarkets it can be quite an eye opener to see the range of classical apples still in existence such as Decio which was grown by the Romans Although it doesn t taste of anything special it s still worth a try as is the knobbly Cat s Head which is more of a curiosity than anything else There are also varieties developed to suit specific local conditions One of the very best varieties for eating quality is Orleans Reinette but you ll need a warm sheltered place with perfect soil to grow it so it s a pipe dream for most apple lovers who fall for it At the events you can

and a lot more going When the the world was still populated by hunter gatherers small tightly knit groups developed their own patterns of speech independent of each other Some language experts believe that years ago when the world had just five to ten million people they spoke perhaps languages between them Soon afterwards many of those people started settling down to become farmers and their languages too became more settled and fewer in number In recent centres trade industrialisation the development of the nation state and the spread of universal compulsory education Especially glbalisation and better communications in the past few decades all have caused many Languages to disappear and dominant languages such as English Spanish and Chinese are increasingly taking over At present the world has about languages The distribution of these languages is hugely uneven The general rule is that mild zones have relatively few languages Often spoken by many people while hot wet zones have lots often spoken by small numbers Europe has only around Languages the Americas about Africa and Asia and the Pacific perhaps of which Papua New Guinea alone accounts for well over The median number of speakers is a mere which means that half the worlds languages are spoken by fewer people than that Already well over of the total of languages are close to extinction with only a few elderly speakers left Pick at random Busuu in Cameroon eight remaining speakers Chiapaneco in Mexico Lipan Apache in the United States two or three or Wadjigu in Australia one with a question mark none of these seems to have much chance of survival What can we infer about languages in huntergatherer times A They developed very fast B They were large in number C They had similar patters D They were closely connected Which of the following best explains dominant underlined in paragraph A Complex B Advanced C Powerful D Modem How many languages are spoken by less than people at present A

Geography determines language evolution D We may think we re a culture that gets rid of our worn technology at the first sight of something shiny and new but a new study shows that we keep using our old devices well after they go out of style That s bad news for the environment and our wallets as these outdated devices consume much more energy than the newer ones that do the same things To figure out how much power these devices are using Callie Babbitt and her colleagues at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York tracked the environmental costs for each product throughout its life from when its minerals are mined to when we stop using the device This method provided a readout for how home energy use has evolved since the early s Devices were grouped by generation Desktop computers basic mobile phones and box set TVs defined Digital cameras arrived on the scene in And MP players smart phones and LCD TVs entered homes in before tablets and e readers showed up in As we accumulated more devices however we didn t throw out our old ones The living room television is replaced and gets planted in the kids room and suddenly one day you have a TV in every room of the house said one researcher The average number of electronic devices rose from four per household in to in We re not just keeping these old devices we continue to use them According to the analysis of Babbitt s team old desktop monitors and box TVs with cathode ray tubes are the worst devices with their energy consumption and contribution to greenhouse gas emissions more than doubling during the to window So what s the solution The team s data only went up to but the researchers also explored what would happen if consumers replaced old products with new electronics that serve more than one function such as a tablet for word processing and TV viewing They found that more on demand entertainment viewing on tablets instead of TVs and desktop computers could cut energy consumption by What does the author think of new devices A They are environment friendly B They are no better than the old C They cost more to use at home D They go out of style quickly Why did Babbitt s team conduct the research A To reduce the cost of minerals B To test the life cycle of a product C To update consumers on new technology D To find out electricity consumption of the devices Which of the following uses the least energy A The box set TV B The tablet C The LCD TV D The desktop computer What does the text suggest people do about old electronic devices A Stop using them B Take them apart C Upgrade them D Recycle them Color is fundamental in home design something you ll always have in every room A grasp of how to manage color in your spaces is one of the first steps to creating rooms you ll love to live in Do you want a room that s full of life Professional Or are you just looking for a place to relax after a long day color is the key to making a room feel the way you want it to feel Over the years there have been a number of different techniques to help designers approach this important point they can get a little complex But good news is that there re really only three kinds of decisions you need to make about color in your home the small ones the medium ones and the large ones They re the little spots of color like throw pillows mirrors and baskets that most of us use to add visual interest to our rooms Less tiring than painting your walls and less expensive than buying a colorful sofa small color choices bring with them the significant benefit of being easily changeable Medium color choices are generally furniture pieces such as sofas dinner tables or bookshelves They require a bigger commitment than smaller ones and they have a more powerful effect on the feeling of a space The large color decisions in your rooms concern the walls ceilings and floors Whether you re looking at wallpaper or paint the time effort and relative expense put into it are significant A While all of them are useful B Whatever you re looking for C If you re experimenting with a color D Small color choices are the ones we re most familiar with E It s not really a good idea to use too many small color pieces F So it pays to be sure because you want to get it right the first time G Color choices in this range are a step up from the small ones in two major ways A B C D During my second year at the city college I was told that the education department was offering a free course called Thinking Chess for three credits I the idea of taking the class because after all who doesn t

which I would be learning from one of the game s I could hardly wait to him Maurice Ashley was kind and smart a former graduate returning to teach and this was no game for him he meant business In his introduction he made it that our credits would be hard earned In order to the class among other criteria we had to write a paper on how we plan to what we would learn in class to our future professions and to our lives I managed to get an A in that and learned life lessons that have served me well beyond the Ten years after my chess class with Ashley I m still putting to use what he me

running shoes Running is cheap easy and it s always energy If you are time poor you need run for only half the time to get the same benefits as other sports so perhaps we should all give a try l

with simple perspectives So my experience of foreign culture boils down to three basic stages anger acceptance and appreciation When I began my life in China I was often filled with frustration and over the way things were Things were seen as clearly and I rejected the view of there being other ways of doing things Afterwards I came to different ways of doing things but still saw my own ways as superior My views were still heavily colored by and I often accepted situations I felt by simply coining the phrase That s China China was a backward country that simply didn t do things correctly

like the way his team perform he instructs his players to call a timeout At this point the game is stopped for a few minutes and the coach gathers the team to discuss adjust which are needed to get the players back on track and to perform more effect Of course during the timeout the coach also points out what the players did is right helps to reinforce their positive behavior Here is the question How often in life do you call a timeout to review what is working for you and to put end to what isn t Probably not often enough Unfortunately we tend become entrenched in habits which are

only can wrinkle the face and turn it yellow it can do the same to the whole body researchers reported on Monday The study published in the Archives of Dermatology shows that smoking affects the skin all over the body even skin protected from the sun We examined non facial skin that was protected from the sun and found that the total number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day and the total years a person has smoked were linked with the amount of skin damage a person experienced Dr Yolanda Helfrich of the University of Michigan who led the study said in a statement In participants older than years smokers had significantly more fine wrinkling than nonsmokers Similar findings were seen in participants aged to years Helfrich s team added in their report The researchers tested people smokers and nonsmokers taking pictures of the inner right arms They ranged in age from to and half were smokers Independent judges decided how wrinkled each person s skin was When skin is exposed to sunlight notably the face it becomes coarse Wrinkled and discolored with a pale yellow tint Helfrich s team wrote Several previous studies have found that cigarette smoking conduces to premature skin aging as measured by facial wrinkles the study said but little has been done to measure the aging of skin not exposed to light The report did not discuss die mechanism involved but previous research has found that cigarette smoke among other things causes blood vessels beneath the skin to constrict reducing blood supply to the skin Smoking can also damage the connective tissue that supports both die skin and the internal organs When your skin is exposed to sunlight long it becomes all of the following Except A discolored B coarse C rough D flexible What does the underlined phrase conduces to in Paragraph mean A help B encourage C prevent D stop How wrinkled a person s skin is doesn t relate to A the number of cigarettes a person smokes B the kind and characteristics of skin C how long a person smokes D how long skin is under sunlight From the passage smoking results in skin aging mainly because A it can make skin come off B it can make you feel tired C it will lower blood supply to skin D it can make blood run faster The main purpose of the passage is to A inform people about the result of the study B advise people how to protect skin C warn people not to smoke again D introduce a new way of avoid skin aging C Every profession or trade every art and every science has its technical vocabulary the function of which is partly to refer to things or processes which have no names in ordinary English and partly to secure greater exactness in expression Such special dialects or jargon are necessary in technical discussion of any kind Being universally understood by the devotees of the particular science or art they have the precision of a mathematical formula Besides they save time for it is much more economical to name a process than to describe it Thousands of these technical terms are very properly included in every large dictionary yet as a whole they are rather on the outskirts of the English language than actually within its borders Different professions however differ widely in the character of their special vocabularies In trades and handicrafts and other professions such as farming and fishing that have occupied great numbers of men from remote times the technical vocabulary is very old It consists largely of native words or of borrowed words that have worked themselves into the very fiber of our language hence though highly technical in many particulars these vocabularies are more familiar in sound and more generally understood than most other technicalities The special dialects of law medicine and philosophy have also become pretty familiar to cultivated person and have contributed much to the popular vocabulary Yet every profession still possesses a large body of technical terms that remain essentially foreign even to educated speech And the proportion has been much increased in the last fifty years particularly in the various departments of natural and political sciences and in the mechanic arts So new terms are coined with the greatest freedom and abandoned with indifference when they have served their turn Most of the new coinages are restricted to special discussions and seldom get into general literature or conversation Yet no profession is nowadays as all profession once were a closed guild The lawyer the physician the man of science and the cleric associate freely with his fellow creatures and do not meet them in a merely professional way Furthermore what is called popular science makes everybody acquainted with modern views and recent discoveries Any important experiment though made in a remote laboratory is at once reported in the newspapers and everybody is soon talking about it as in the case of the Roentgen rays and wireless telegraphy Thus our common speech is always taking up new technical terms and making them commonplace What is the passage mainly about A Technical terms characters in different occupations B Technical terms s popularity in different cultures C Technical vocabulary development D Technical vocabulary s functions What does the underlined sentence in Para mean A Technical terms are usually used in the urban areas B Technical terms are always used in the rural areas C Technical terms don t constitute the core of common speech D Technical terms are not understood by English farmers From the passage we can learn that A it is easier to become a professional today than it was in the past B there is more social communication between professionals and others C popular science has told its secrets to people all over the world D no one can understand more things in profession now than ever It can be concluded from the last paragraph that A the English language is becoming increasingly expanded B the words of the English language are always changing now C one can never be sure what a word means without consulting an expert D technical terms have little chance of being the main body of the language The author mentions Roentgen rays and wireless telegraphy as examples of A rapid occurrence of jargon B quick talk of an experiment C precision of jargon in meaning D fast expansion of technical words D With the Tesla Roadster and other plug in electric vehicles hitting the road demand is growing for accessible refueling points to recharge them Carbon Day Automotive a Chicago based company has now demonstrated a solar powered recharging point known as the Solar Plug In Station which lets motorists easily charge their cars using electricity that has been produced without any environmental damage The Solar Plug In Station has gone on show in Chicago as part of the city s bid to host the Olympic Games According to Carbon Day Automotive the Solar Plug In Station on show in Chicago is part of the vital infrastructure required for electric vehicles in Chicago and was the focus of a recent visit by the International Olympic Committee These solar powered electricity points will be used daily to fuel the city s electric vehicles with power from the sun By producing the electricity from pollution free solar cell the CO emissions are reduced to zero Solar energy and electric vehicles are a partnership that is one more step to reducing our dependence on foreign oil says Richard Lowenthal CEO of Coulomb Technologies Coulomb Technologies recently developed the components required for individual recharging stations marketed as ChargePoint Networked Charging Stations Carbon Day Automotive is the Midwest distributor for the ChargePoint stations The Solar Plug In Station consists of giant solar panels that shade the tiny ChargePoint Networked Charging Station The solar panel is connected to an underground battery pack ready for everyday refueling Without these stations it would be like driving around in a traditional car without the availability of gas stations says Scott Emalfarb CEO at Carbon Day The day of true plug in electric vehicles will be here sooner than most people realize and the world needs to be ready to accommodate them The Solar Plug In Station is used as part of the bid to host the Olympics mainly because A it s environmentally friendly B it makes up for the lack of electricity C it s a new idea and attracts people s attention D it brings convenience to electric vehicle users We can learn from the passage that A to recharge the electric vehicles takes a long time B the Solar Plug In Station will come into use in C the Solar Plug In Station has gone on show internationally D Chicago is promoting the use of electric vehicles According to the passage how many of the following statements are TRUE a Tesla Roadster is a kind of plug in electric vehicle b The Solar Plug In Station uses solar power to charge all of the cars c Chicago is a city which is rich in oil d The Solar Plug In Station consists of underground battery packs e Scott Emalfarb is optimistic about the future of plug in electric vehicles A B C D The passage implies that when the Solar Plug In Station becomes popular A more visitors will come to Chicago B the citizens of Chicago will be able to go to work faster C more space for electric vehicles will be needed D the cost of electric vehicles will be lower than traditional cars What would be the best title for the passage A Chicago Will Soon Be Full of Electric Vehicles B Chicago Calls on People to Buy Electric Vehicles C Chicago

school student takes a part time job as a newspaper delivering boy In hopes of earning money to go to college and winning a prize he works hard and does so good a job that all of his customers think highly of him Nowadays there is a growing tendency that more and more high school graduates have part time jobs after graduation Some work as shop assistants or waiters Some distribute handbills on the street and some act as private tutors Students can get great benefit from taking part time jobs in vacations Several reasons can account for this First taking a part time job to some extent can help to solve the financial problem for those coming from poor families Second such jobs provide students with good opportunities to enrich their social experience and broaden their horizons which will do good to them in their future study and life Last the jobs make it possible for students to put what they have learned in class into practice After graduation I tend to have a part time job as

no longer just about how great brands break into the Chinese market It s also about an important part of China s economy coming to you If you are a brand manager or a salesman you re increasingly likely to find yourself fighting with the push of Chinese e commerce companies in your home market That s for two reasons China s leadership in electronic payments and the continued rise in Chinese tourism The result of this is that Chinese consumers are an increasingly important factor in markets around the world On the electronic payment front there are some strong reasons to introduce the electronic payment systems Chinese consumers are already using In China the traditional wallet has been replaced by an electronic wallet on a smartphone It s common to make all of your payments for daily needs through that smartphone using one of the two main electronic payment providers WeChat Pay or Alipay It s not just easy to use These two tech companies have the influence and customer base to push their payment systems beyond their original e commerce area Noodle shops will take electronic payments and even street musicians have QR for donations Whether you are paying your electricity bill or seeing a doctor your mobile phone can handle the payment As a result China is today the most cash free of any of the world s major economies and that trend will continue Already the numbers are staggering According to a survey by Ipsos and Tencent of Chinese people do not carry any cash while hold less than RMB less than in their wallets day to day According to consulting firm iResearch

and more popular B Chinese economy is taking up a bigger share internationally C Great brands find it harder to enter the Chinese market D The world market is determined by Chinese tourists What is the author s attitude towards China s e commerce A Doubtful B Positive C Disapproving D Uncaring Which can best replace the underlined word staggering in the last paragraph A Proper B Important C Popular D Impressive D Many people wrongly think that cities don t have farms and that fruits and vegetables are only grown in the country Believe it or not there are more and more urban farms popping up in cities all over the world Alexandra Sullivan a food system researcher in New York City studies urban agriculture Urban agriculture is another name for farming and gardening in a city environment Ms Sullivan studies everything from tiny gardens in empty lots between buildings to bigger fields that have been planted and grown According to Ms Sullivan Urban agriculture has existed since cities have across the world The number of humans living in urban areas or cities is increasing The amount of people who want to garden in urban areas is also rising Ms Sullivan says In small gardens on rooftops and indoors they grow fruits vegetables grains and herbs and raise animals to produce milk eggs honey and meat They use these foods as supplements to food produced by rural agriculture Even though some people who live in urban areas grow crops urban residents still need to rely on food grown in rural areas This is because a city doesn t have enough space to grow enough food for everyone living in it In New York City urban farmers have come up with many different ways to grow their own produce even though there isn t a lot of room For example Brooklyn Grange is a farming operation that has two rooftop vegetable farms in New York City All together the farms are made up of acres of rooftop space This makes Brooklyn Grange one of the largest rooftop farming operations in the world Brooklyn Grange grows all kinds of things The farming company sells its vegetables to local residents and restaurants And because the farms are on rooftops they are specially adapted to their urban location They use available space that is not needed for anything else As more urban farmers find ways to grow food in cities urban residents will be better able to get fresher materials for their meals Which of the following is Ms Sullivan s opinion according to the text A Urban agriculture is disappearing all over the world B Urban agriculture is another name for farming C Urban agriculture has a history as long as cities D Foods are only grown in tiny gardens in cities Why do people in the cities still rely on foods grown in the rural areas according to Paragraph A The foods grown in rural areas are supplements to the foods grown in urban areas B There is not enough space to grow enough food for everyone in the cities C The number of people wanting to grow food in urban areas is increasing D People need different kinds of food What can we learn about Brooklyn Grange in New York City from the text A It provides most of the foods in cities B It can only grow single products C It is the only largest farming operation in the world D It makes use of rooftop space to grow vegetables What may be the best title for the text A Farms in Cities B Future Food System C Food Grown in Cities D Agriculture of New York City How to Choose Your College Major When you were in high school everyone wanted to know where you were going to go to college If you don t know how to choose your

There are more bicycles than residents in the Netherlands and in cities like Amsterdam and The Hague up to of all journeys are made by bike The BBC s reporter Anna Holligan examines what made everyone get back in the saddle Before World War journeys in the Netherlands were mainly made by bike but in the s and s as car ownership increased quickly this changed As in many countries in Europe roads became increasingly crowded The jump in car number caused a huge rise in the number of deaths on the roads In more than people were killed by motor vehicles and of them were children In response a social movement demanding safer cycling conditions for children was formed Called Stop de Kindermoord it took its name from the headline of an article written by journalist Vic Langenhoff whose own child had been killed in a road accident The Dutch love of the motor vehicle was also shaken by the Middle East oil crisis of when oil producing countries topped export to the US and Western Europe These twin pressures helped to persuade the Dutch government to invest in improving cycling infrastructure and the Dutch urban planners started to change from the road building policies designed mainly for cars To make cycling safer and more inviting the Dutch have built a vast network of cycle paths These are clearly marked have smooth surfaces separate signs and lights for those on two wheels and are wide enough to allow cycling side by side and overtaking Even before they can walk Dutch children live in a world of cycling As babies they travel in special seats on bikes As the children grow up they ride their own bikes And as the Dutch are not allowed to drive until cycling offers teenagers an alternative form of freedom The state also plays a part in teaching with cycling lessons a compulsory part in Dutch schools All schools have places to park bikes and at some schools of pupils cycle to class What does Anna Holligan intend to find out A Why cycling is popular in the Netherlands B How journeys are made in the Netherlands C What s the main means of transport in the Netherlands D What makes the children like cycling in the Netherlands Stop de Kindermoord is aimed at A advising people to travel by bike B calling on more children to cycle C improving cycling conditions for children D asking the government to invest more in cycling What resulted in the Dutch government s changing road building policies A More cars and road accidents B More cars and higher oil prices C Road accidents and oil shortage D A social movement and oil crisis What do we learn about the Dutch children A They must get a license to ride a bike B They are not allowed to drive until C They must have cycling lessons at school D They don t use bikes when they are very young C

least some decisions to them So what should the children do First hear out all the plans that your parents have made for you If you have some different ideas then sit down and talk to your family about it Be patient and respect their decisions but put your plan forth and make them understand what you want to do and why Many times you don t know the difficulties that you may have to face while

to make one student s day extra special this sunny Friday morning His name is Bobby Smith Yeah Bobby this is for you Bobby does great with his studies and will probably graduate with honors but that s

Green had learned that her uncle had passed away She hadn t seen him for years but he had meant a lot to her when she was growing up Realizing how sad she looked Bobby had his mom who runs a flower shop deliver a bunch of flowers to Ms Green on her lunch break Ms Green who is now flying back to New York to be with her family said she was so touched by what Bobby did that it allowed her to make it through the rest of the day Thanks Bobby The lesson here is for us to be good each other A B C D A I sat with my friend in a well known coffee shop in a neighboring town of Venice As we enjoyed our coffee a man called the waiter and placed his order Two cups of coffee one on the wall We got interested and observed that he was served with one cup of coffee but he paid for two As soon as he left the waiter attached a piece of paper to the wall saying A Cup of Coffee Similar occasions took place twice while we were there It seemed that this gesture was quite normal at this place However it was something unique and confusing for us After a few days when we again enjoyed coffee there a man entered The way this man was dressed did not match the standard or the atmosphere of this coffee shop Poverty was evident from his looks As he seated himself he looked at the wall and said One cup of coffee from the wall The waiter served coffee to this man with respect and dignity The man had his coffee and left without paying We were amazed to watch all this when the waiter took off a piece of paper from the wall and threw it in the dustbin Now it was no surprise for us the matter was very clear The great respect for the needy shown by people in this town moved us to tears Coffee is not a necessity However the point is that when we take pleasure in any blessing maybe we also need to think about those people who also appreciate that specific blessing but cannot afford Note the waiter who gets the communication going between the affording and the needy with a smile on his face Think about the man in need he enters the coffee shop without having to lower his self dignity he has a free cup of coffee without asking or knowing about who has given this cup of coffee to him he only looked at the wall placed an order for himself enjoyed his coffee and left Besides we need to remember the role played by the wall that reflects the generosity and care of people in this town What made the author interested as well as confused A The waiter s making normal gestures B Customers buying coffee for the needy C The waiter s attaching coffee orders on the wall D Customers paying for coffee and having it put on the wall The author thought the man in need was A obviously poor B not properly dressed C not right to leave without paying D strange to order coffee from the wall In the author s opinion coffee is A necessary in our life B a blessing some can t afford C respect shown for the needy D a blessing everyone should have The passage is mainly concerned about A learning from the waiter B buying coffee for others C caring more about the people in need D analyzing the characters in the coffee shop B Running out of cooking oil or need some dressing for your salad The solution may be bugs from your backyard Scientists are turning insects into a source of eatable and healthy oil Even though serving insects as dishes is common in some parts of the world to many people the thought of eating them is rather disgusting In the Western countries there is no culture of eating entire insects So when the idea is to use the protein in powder as an ingredient people might tend to receive this protein better on condition that they cannot see it said researcher Daylan Tzompas Sosa Wageningen University Netherlands There are many uses for the oil in general but we are investigating the use of these oils for a food as a food ingredient The Mexican researcher working in the Netherlands said insects are a great source of heart healthy omega fatty acids which can help treat anxiety disorder symptoms Backing up the increased reliance on insects is the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization In a report the UN agency approved the cultivation of bugs as a food source saying it s environmentally friendly and could increase the world s food production There are clear reasons that experts advise people to eat the insects Experts say insects require little food to grow and that the backyard can be a good place to raise them And there s no shortage of protein rich insects which also contain fat vitamins fiber and minerals Researchers say different bugs provide unique tastes and textures This is very liquid and it has a different color so this can be used as a dressing for example and it s easy to use and this can be used for example for pastry because for pastry you need hard fats stated Tzompas Sosa But not all insects produce good oil Cockroaches don t The bug oils must be tested to make sure they are safe to consume But getting over the disgusting feeling may be a bigger challenge What is the author s attitude towards the use of bug oils A Doubtful B Objective C Supportive D Unfavorable Which of the following can replace the underlined phrase Backing up A Raising B Rejecting C Supporting D Enjoying From the last paragraph we can learn that A all insects cannot produce good oil B the bug oils are the most delicious C it s safe to consume the bug oils D the use of bug oils is banned C In ancient Egypt a shopkeeper discovered that he could attract customers to his shop simply by making changes to its environment Modern businesses have been following his lead with more tactics One tactic involves where to display the goods Foe example stores place fruits and vegetables in the first section They know that customers who buy the healthy food first will feel happy so that they will buy more junk food later in their trip In department stores the women s shoe section is generally next to the women s cosmetics section while the shop assistant is going back to find the right size shoe bored customers are likely to wander over and find some cosmetics they might want to try later Besides businesses seek to appeal to customers senses Stores notice that the smell of baked goods encourages shopping so they make their own bread each morning and then fan the bread smell into the store throughout the day Music sells goods too Researchers in Britain found that when French music was played sales of French wine went up When it comes to the selling o f houses businesses also use highly rewarding tactics They find that customers make decisions in the first few seconds upon walking in the door and turn it into a business opportunity A California builder designed the structure of its houses smartly When entering the house the customer would see the Pacific Ocean through the windows and then the pool through an open stairway leading to the lower level The instant view of water on both levels helped sell these million houses Why do stores usually display fruits and vegetables in the first section A To save customers time B To show they are high quality foods C To help sell junk food D To sell them at discount prices According to Paragraph which of the following encourages customers to buy A Opening the store early in the morning B Displaying British wines next to French ones C Inviting customers to play music D Filling the store with the smell of fresh bread What is the California builder s story intended to prove A The house structure is a key factor customers consider B The more costly the house is the better it sells C An ocean view is much to the customers taste D A good first impression increases sales What is the main purpose of the passage A To explain how businesses turn people into their customers B To introduces how businesses have grown from the past C To report researches on customer behavior D To show dishonest business practices D Ever feel like scratching yourself when you see others doing it You re probably not alone This practice which seems to be socially contagious could be more than just a sudden urge This is according to the latest finding from Washington University The researchers studied mice to see what went on in their brains when they saw other mice scratching During the experiments a mouse was placed in front of a computer screen to watch another of its kind scratching A few moments after watching the video the live mouse would start scratching The finding is interesting because earlier studies had shown that mice only show empathy with individuals they know and the mouse on the screen was a stranger for the live mouse This means that empathy may have nothing to do with the need to scratch When the researchers analyzed the brain activity of the mice after viewing the video they recorded increased level of gastrin releasing peptide GRP In the previous research GRP is found to be responsible for transferring the itch feeling between the brain and the skin However when researchers blocked the GRP s function the mice simply stopped scratching in response to seeing other mice scratching This means that mice have no control over their scratching when seeing peers scratching The mouse doesn t see another mouse scratching and then thinks it might need to scratch Instead its brain begins sending out itch signals using GRP as a messenger It s not clear if the exact same pathway exists in humans But the team believes the study could help throw light on the neural mechanisms behind contagious behaviors in human beings The next time you scratch in response to someone else doing it remember it s really not a choice nor a psychological response it s hardwired into your brain What have the latest experiments found A Mice only imitate the act of their familiar peers B Mice prefer the mice on a computer screen to the live ones C Mice feel the need to scratch when seeing another scratching D Mice just have to scratch when seeing another scratching What can we learn about GRP A The mouse decreased its GRP when seeing other mice scratching B GRP is meant to block the itching and scratching feeling C Without GRP s function the mice wouldn t copy the scratch D GRP exists and functions the same in human brains The underlined word hardwired in the last paragraph probably means A changed B mended C stopped D fixed Which is the best title A The Contagious Scratch B The Clever Imitation C The Strange Behavior D The Common Response Do teenagers know how to sleep If you re the parent of teens you might be laughing to yourself That s all they know how to do In truth teens might not know enough about how to sleep when to sleep and why Just as we focus on our diets and exercise for health we need to consider sleep necessary to our mental physical and psychological health Good sleep is sleep that is long enough to allow your brain to remove the side effects of daytime brain activity Consistent bed times and wakeup times are the key to keeping our sleep cycles Teens are social creatures and the most attractive social gathering place these days is on their digital devices Ideally we should avoid blue light for at least half an hour before bed But social media and homework that requires screen time mean too many kids are powering up their devices when their bodies should be powering down for the night Equally contributing to sleep issues are eating too late taking naps and failing to get enough exercise In other words these people never learned how to sleep Over time poor sleep leads to a decline in mood Significantly when I speak to my adult patients who are struggling with sleep issues nearly all of them say their sleep problems started in high school Therefore I recommend sleep education Otherwise we won t necessarily solve the health safety and economic issues of sleepy teens A When they are disturbed our sleep is affected B Going to bed too late is only one part of sleep problems C Being exposed to blue light from our screens delays sleep D Current school schedules allow for about seven hours of sleep a night E It also contributes to a lot of medical issues from being fat to heart disease F Later school start time really contributes to more sleep and improved health G As far as I m concerned one important element is missing sleep education A B C D When I was four I was a

Southey One of nature s most magical illusions Once upon a time in the faraway land of the Faroe Islands Lake Leitisvatn became known as the most striking of all the islands lakes At more than km long

donating two of his organs to complete strangers Steven chose to have percent of his liver removed so that he could sat the life of a young child four years after donating one of his kidneys to another recipient Steven was very taken by the idea He spent a few months considering it and at last he made the decision when he was out for a walk on New Year s Day this year At the time he was thinking about what he wanted to achieve this year He knew it was his th birth y wanted to do something significant When he told his doctors about this thought there was great astonishment from them as nobody had yet donated a kidney and part of a liver to strangers The majority of organs are donated to family relatives or very close friends but here you don t I know who is going to get it Steven underwent surgery at Leeds St James Hospital following several months of assessments ments including an ECG MRI and ultra sound scans blood testing and a psychological interview that confirmed he was in good health and was a suitable candidate Steven thought it was a short term discommodity for long term benefit A couple of months of reduced mobility and a bit of discomfort were a very small price to pay when you were aware you had saved a life It got you through the darker moments Dr Lisa Bumapp one of Steven s doctors said More than donors volunteer each year to donate a kidney to someone they do not know However liver donation is much less common Mr Norrie is the first double donor who gives two separate organs Living donation is highly successful but most people do not have someone who can donate to them and only some organs can be donated from a living person Patients waiting for a transplant rely heavily on generous people donating their organs after death To give an organ to a loved one is an incredible act of generosity That Steven has given twice to people he doesn t know is truly remarkable Steven decided to donate part of his liver because A he was unable to live long B he was the only suitable candidate C he wanted to save the life of his friend D he wanted to make his life more meaningful Hearing Steven s thought the doctors were A shocked B concerned C confused D interested The underlined word discommodity in Paragraph probably means A sickness B damage C inconvenience D dissatisfaction Which word can best describe Steven Norrie A Brave and smart B Selfless and caring C Hardworking and generous D Responsible and longsighted C As more and more schools rush to put digital devices in the hands of every student many parents are becoming increasingly concerned about the quality of their children s education The promise of increased student academic achievement through the use of technology hasn t really produced any significant results in the past years Researchers at the University of California Los Angeles conducted a study in to determine if the social skills of elementary students were blocked by screen time Two groups of sixth grade students were compared One group was sent to an outdoor camp tor one week with no screen time while the control group live life as normal After one week the students at comp had made significant improvements over their peers The good news is that when we limit access to screen time and give children the opportunity to interact face to face they quickly become better at reading non verbal cues and determining the emotional state of others The bad news is that we have a generation of children that struggle with this basic emotional intelligence skill Too much screen time has been linked to childhood obesity sleep disorders behavior problems and academic challenges But is there a difference between schoolwork and entertainment media When students are using technology for academic work they are more likely to be communicating with peers working cooperatively and developing other important skills However all these are impossible when students watch entertainment media They just sit and watch Parents have right to be concerned about their children s screen time at school but they should begin by discussing the use of digital media at home Some parents are continuously engaged in their own devices responding to every ring of their phones receiving and sending messages How can they expect their children to do better What was the schools initial intention of using digital devices A To improve students academically B To help students develop socially C To make school life more entertaining and colorful D To make sure students get technological education What aspect of children worries the writer a lot A Lacking guidance on proper screen time B Lacking chances to communicate with other C Lacking interest in improving their study D Lacking skills in reading others emotional state What attitude does the writer have to the use of digital devices in schoolwork A Positive B Concerned C Negative D Uncertain From the passage we can learn that A parents shouldn t oppose schools in their educational approaches B some parents may set a bad example to their children in using distal media C the screen watching time shouldn t be longer than hours for students D it s wrong for schools to focus on technological education D Companion planting is the idea that some kinds of plants can help each other grow Plants that are compatible together generally have similar needs in terms of nutrients soil and moisture levels Advice about which plants are compatible is sometimes based more on tradition than proof But experts say there is evidence to support certain combinations These can improve harvests reduce disease and help with pest control by attracting helpful insects For example some kinds of soil bacteria take nitrogen from the air and make it into a form that plants can use The plants hold the nitrogen in their roots Legumes are especially good at this nitrogen fixing Then any crops that share the same space with the legumes can get the nitrogen when the roots are broken down Beans and potatoes can also share territory well because their roots reach different levels in the soil Deep rooted vegetables get nutrients and moisture from lower down in the soil so they do not compete with plants with shallower roots But some plants placed together may harm each other s development For example tomatoes do not like wet soil but watercress does so you would probably want to keep them separated Some kinds of produce should be kept apart even after being harvested This is because of ethylene gas Ethylene is a plant hormone that can cause some foods to ripen too quickly Apples release ethylene gas Apricots melons and tomatoes also release a lot of ethylene Some vegetable are easily affected by ethylene including asparagus broccoli cabbage and cucumbers This risk ripening too soon is why markets often separate high ethylene producing foods from those that are sensitive to the gas But if you put an apple in a bag with a green banana the ethylene from the apple will make the banana ready to eat sooner What about peaches plums and nectarines These kinds of fruit do not need any help from an apple they release enough ethylene to ripen themselves But that does not mean there is no way to get the job done faster Growers suggest placing the fruit in a fruit bowl or in a paper bag with the top folded over Keep the fruit at room temperature out of direct sunlight Once the fruit is soft enough either use it or put it in the refrigerator to keep it from getting too ripe Companion planting refers to the idea that A some crops can grow together to benefit each other B some crops have the similar needs of nutrients soil and water level C some plants can damage each other if grown together D a good farming method to prevent natural disasters According to the text cannot grow together A beans and potatoes B tomatoes and watercress D rice and sugarcane C legumes and corns What is the function of ethylene A To improve the quality of fruits B To produce a poisonous gas C To keep vegetables fresh D To make fruits ripe earlier The text is most likely to be taken from A a newspaper of medicine B a magazine of biology C a journal of agriculture D a travel report In life change is unavoidable Here are a few things you need to know to deal with major life changes You can cry Do not pretend things are okay or be ashamed

it was to please someone and gain for my efforts This sometimes led to or frustration When I was an IT manager after college graduation I was to work with a wealth customer and be a go between for my company I took on the assignment thinking that this might be my rime to shine the customer s demands proved to be more than I could do with And the company chose to the customer and try to meet his unreasonable requirements rather than stick to what we had offered in the contract As you can imagine this led to a lot of unexpected and arguing with some of the staff who to do anything outside

arranged marriage Thailand wants you to exchange vows in Bangkok Phuket or elsewhere in this wedding paradise This wedding business starts from overseas with the Indians Thai embassies in India give quick services for the visas Not only the couples you can bring anyone say your own cook So feel free to invite hundreds of your friends and relatives Why would Indians want to spend so much on weddings in Thailand Partly because they have similarities in religion When Indian weddings want to have some religious prayer for the couples Thailand can do that But the more obvious appeal are Thailand s fancy hotels tropical islands and delicious Thai food allowing new couples to include a honeymoon in Thailand after they say I do while their guests also celebrate on a holiday here But on the other hand love does have a price Kasu Rajagopal arranged for his daughter to have a wedding in Phuket They arranged entertainment to begin three days before the wedding because guests arrival time varied Yachts were arranged to take guests to small islands while a DJ from Bangalore India was booked to help them dance in the evening Kasu also arranged priests for the Hindu wedding and cooks to prepare Indian food The approximate costs are around half a million US dollars including the airfares hotel accommodation food transportation the yachts on hire and the wedding ceremony expenses for to guests Thailand wants to make itself a wedding paradise for all couples not just from India but from around the world Last year there were around to couples from China and the numbers are

adults eat more sugar today than they did in the s We all know that too much sugar isn t good for you But did we know it could be dangerous A team of researchers at the University of Utah used mice to conduct a study to prove the toxic effects of eating more sugar They found it could influence people s health seriously During the week long study mice were fed a diet containing more sugar This percentage equals a healthy human diet along with three cans of soda daily The team found that these mice were twice as likely to die as mice fed a similar diet without the sugar Though the mice did not show signs of obesity or high blood pressure male mice produced fewer offspring than the other mice The reason why mice were chosen for research by scientists are not far to seek Mice have the genetic structure similar to humans Most substances that are harmful to mice are also harmful to people It s likely that those underlying physical problems that cause those mice to have increased the death rate are at play in people says study author James Ruff of the University of Utah Findings from this study reveal negative effects that are not as detectable as weight gain or heart problems Sugar can contribute to long term changes in the body that can alter development and even shorten lives Different types of sugar have different effects on the human body Some of the sugar we consume comes from foods we might expect candy soda and cookies But much of the sugar that we eat if hidden Food companies add large amounts of sugar to items we may not classify as sweets To help cut down on extra sugar consumption nutrition experts suggest looking at the ingredients on food packages Cutting sugar out of the American diet altogether may be difficult But making the effort to control our nation s sugar cravings will provide for a truly sweeter future The underlined word toxic in Paragraph i probably means A ridiculous B skeptical C poisonous D reasonable According to Paragraph we can know A the study conducted on mice lasted less than a year B the study shows the bad effects of more sugar on mice C mice eating more sugar than others live longer D mice eating more sugar will become fatter and fatter Why did the scientists choose the mice to conduct the study A They have a similar genetic structure to humans B They are sensitive to the taste of the sweet C They are easy to take in the harmful substances D They have a longer lifespan than other animals Which suggestion is put forward by nutrition experts A Choosing the food without any sugar to eat B Buying the food rich in sugar to consume C Eating the food with sugar hidden in it D Checking the labels of the food before buying Nearly everyone has spent at least one night lying in bed wishing for sleep But for many it s

may have come from an argument a misunderstanding the way we were raised or some other painful events Stubbornly we wait for someone else to reach out to us believing this is the only way we can forgive or rekindle a friendship or family relationship A friend of mine recently told me that she hadn t spoken to her son in almost three years She said that she and her son had had a disagreement about his wife and that she wouldn t speak to him again unless he called first When I suggested that she be the one to reach out she said I can t do that He s the one who should apologize After a little gentle encouragement however she did decide to be the first one to reach out To her amazement her son was grateful for her willingness to call and offered an apology of his own As is usually the case when someone takes the chance and reaches out everyone wins Whenever we hold on to our anger we turn small stuff into really big stuff in our minds We start to believe that our positions are more important than our happiness They are not If you want to be a more peaceful person you must understand that being right is almost never more important than allowing yourself to be happy The way to be happy is to let go and reach out Let other people be right This doesn t mean that you re wrong Everything will be fine You ll experience the peace of letting go as well as the joy of letting others be right You ll also notice that as you reach out and let others be right they will become less defensive and more loving toward you They might even reach back But if for some reason they don t that s okay too You ll have the inner satisfaction of knowing that you have done your part to create a more loving world and certainly you ll be more peaceful yourself The underlined word rekindle in

languages listed above is probably a safe bet You want to speak to as many people as possible How about Chinese Spanish or French Chinese Although Chinese has three times more native speakers than English it s still not as evenly spread over the world Moreover Chinese is rarely used in sciences and difficult to read and write Spanish Spanish makes up for a lack of native speakers compared with China by being particularly popular as a second language taught in schools around the world French French has lost grounds in some regions and especially in Europe in the last decades French however

are left handed Why One theory centers on the two halves of the brain For example the left half and the right half each of which functions differently Medical science believes that the left half of the brain dominates over the right half The foundation of this theory is the fact that nerves from the brain cross over at neck level to the opposite side of the body and nerves from the other side of the brain reciprocate The end re sult is that the opposite sides of the body are controlled by the opposite sides of the brain The dominant left half of the brain which kindly supplies the right half of the body theoretically makes it more skillful in read ing writing speaking and working and makes most people right handed Lefties however whose right half of the brain dominates work best with the left side of their bodies Theory number two focuses on the asymmetrical nature of the body Examples of the asymmetry which flows from head to toe are that the right side of our faces differs slightly from the left that our legs differ in strength or that our feet vary in size One aspect of this asymmetry is that for most people the right hand is stronger than the left There is no doubt that all exist in a right handed society which produces most basics including scissors doorknobs locks screwdrivers automobiles buttons on clothing and musical instru ments for the Left handed people make up for the unfairness by being members of an elite society which includes many of the greatest geniuses including Michelangelo and Leonardo Davinci Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage A Left handed people are better at speaking B Left handed people are believed to have stronger left halves of the brains C Right handed people work best with the right side of their bodies D Right handed people are cleverer than left handed people Which of the words or phrases is closest in meaning to the word asymmetrical A not balanced B valuable C not typical D negative What can be inferred from the passage A This is an equal society for the left handed people B Most great geniuses are left handed C Left handed people are considered to be disabled D Left handed people may feel inconvenient in this right handed society What s the best title for the passage A Which proves to be the better way to live right handed or left handed B How do left handed people differ from right handed ones C Are left handed people equally treated in society D Why are some people left handed Everyone faces problems in his her daily life Don t worry As long as you are breathing you can solve problems Be aware of problem First of all it is important to know and understand the problem clearly Following questions like why what how when where and who will take you to the root cause of the problem Analyze the problem Analyzing the problem will give you time to think of a proper solution They can be diagrams flowcharts or a lists etc Plan a strategy Planning a strategy will help you waste less energy and time in attempting all the solutions This step includes knowing the pros and cons of applying a solution In this way you can abandon the strategy that you don t find worthy to apply Leave out the information that is not required for the solving of the problem You need to be accurate with the details Keeping the unrelated information can sometimes complicate the simple problem as we tend to overlook the important information Carry out the solution Putting the solution into effect in a correct way to get the result expected is important while solving a problem You need to be creative while actualizing a solution just in case some other problem arises while applying the solution A Keep unrelated information B You can use various tools to study the problem C Delete irrelevant information D Knowing the problem means solving half the problem itself E They can be social problems relationship problems or problems at work F Spend of the time analyzing the problem and on the solution not the opposite G Being ready with alternatives is also important in case a solution works only half way A B C D Alia Baker is a librarian in Iraq Her library used to be a

that he could catch many fish while I couldn t catch anything I usually got pretty upset and kept asking him why He always answered Son if you want to catch a fish you have to think like a fish I remember being even more upset then because I m not a fish I didn t know how to think like a fish Besides I reasoned how could what I think influence what a fish does As I got a little older I began to understand what my dad really meant So I read some books on fish And I even joined the local fishing club and started attending the monthly meetings I learned that a fish is a cold blooded animal and therefore is very sensitive to water temperature That is why fish prefer shallow water to deep water because the former is warmer Besides water is usually warmer in direct sunlight than in the shade Yet fish don t have any eyelids and the sun huts their eyes The more I understood fish the more I became effective at finding and catching them When I grew up and entered the business world I remember hearing my first boss say We all need to think like sales people But it didn t completely make sense My dad never once said If you want to catch a fish you need to think like a fisherman What he said was You need to think like a fish Years later with great efforts to promote long term services to people much older and richer than me I gradually learned what we all need is to think more like customers It is not an easy job I will show you how in the following chapters Why was the author upset in fishing trips when he was nine A He could not catch a fish B His father was not patient with him C His father did not teach him fishing D He could not influence a fish as his father did What did the author s father really mean A To read about fish B To learn fishing by oneself C To understand what fish think D To study fishing in many ways According to the author fish are most likely to be found A in deep water on sunny days B in deep water on cloudy days C in shallow water under sunlight D in shallow water under waterside trees After entering the business world the author found A it easy to think like a customer B his father s fishing advice inspiring C his first boss s sales ideas reasonable D it difficult to sell services to poor people This passage most likely comes from A a fishing guide B a popular sales book C a novel on childhood D a millionaire s biography C Why do Americans struggle with watching their weight while the French who consume rich food continue to stay thin Now a research by Cornell University suggests how life style and decisions about eating may affect weight Researchers concluded that the French tend to stop eating when they feel full However Americans tend to stop when their plate is empty or their favorite TV show is over According to Dr Joseph Mercola a health expert the French see eating as an important part of their life style They enjoy food and therefore spend a fairly long time at the table while Americans see eating as something to be squeezed between the other daily activities Mercola believes Americans lose the ability to sense when they are actually full So they keep eating long after the French would have stopped In addition he points out that Americans drive to huge supermarkets to buy canned and frozen foods for the week The French instead tend to shop daily walking to small shops and farmers markets where they have a choice of fresh fruits vegetables and eggs as well as high quality meats for each meal After a visit to the United States Mireille Guiliano author of French Women Don t Get Fat decided to write about the importance of knowing when to stop rather than suggesting how to avoid food Today she continues to stay slim and rarely goes to the gym In spite of all these differences evidence shows that recent life style changes may be affecting French eating habits Today the rate of obesity or extreme overweight among adults is only However as American fast food gains acceptance and the young reject older traditions the obesity rate among French children has reached and is growing In what way are the French different from Americans according to Dr Joseph Mercola A They go shopping at supermarkets more frequently B They squeeze eating between the other daily activities C They regard eating as a key part of their lifestyles D They usually eat too much canned and frozen food This text is mainly the relationship between A Americans and the French B life style and obesity C children and adults D fast food and overweight Where does this text probably come from A A TV interview B A food advertisement C A health report D A book review D People aren t walking any more if they can figure out a way to avoid it I felt superior about this matter until the other day I took my car to mail a small parcel The journey is a matter of steps But I used the car And I wasn t in a hurry either I had merely become one more victim of a national sickness motorosis It is an illness to which I had thought myself immune for I was born in the tradition of going to places on my own two legs At that time we regarded miles as good day s walk and the ability to cover such a distance in ten hours as sign of strength and skill It did not occur to us that walking was a hardship And the effect was lasting When I was years old I raced and beat a teenage football player the steps up the Stature of Liberty Such enterprises today are regarded by many middle aged persons as bad for the heart But a well known British physician Sir Adolphe Abrhams pointed out recently that hearts and bodies need proper exercise A person who avoids exercise is more likely to have illnesses than one who exercises regularly And walking is an ideal form of exercise the most familiar and natural of all It was Henry Thoreau who showed mankind the richness of going on foot The man walking can learn the trees flowers insects birds and animals the significance of seasons the very feel of himself as a living creature in a living world He cannot learn in a car The car is a convenient means of transport but we have made it our way of life Many people don t dare to approach Nature any more to them the world they were born to enjoy is all threat To them security is a steel river thundering on a concrete road And much of their thinking takes place while waiting for the traffic light to turn green I say that the green of forests is the mind s best light And none but the man on foot can evaluate what is basic and everlasting What is the national sickness A Walking too much B Traveling too much C Driving cars too much D Climbing stairs too much What was life like when the author was young A People usually went around on foot B people often walked miles a day C People used to climb the Statue of Liberty D People considered a ten hour walk as a hardship What is the author s intention of writing this passage A To tell people to reflect more non life B To recommend people

her a lot was that there were no red corrections about the mistakes One day when my mother went to meet Mrs White for one of those Parent Teacher meetings She ask Mrs White why she never corrected my mistakes and pointed out my grammar errors Mrs White said The children are just beginning to get excite about using words and forming sentences I don t want to damage their interests with red ink Spelling and grammar can wait the wonder of words won t I grow up with time go by And it occurs to me that if Mrs White had used her red pen more precisely I probably wouldn t be telling you about

a PE lesson while I fell down and hurt my foot I was in greatly pain at that moment but I tried to act as if nothing has happened until the class was over Though I had difficulty walk back to my

supported by an object However the cold and stiff body told them that she had passed away for sure The rescuers left this house and were going to search the next collapsed building For some reason the team leader was driven by a strange force to go back to the ruined house Again he knelt down to search the little space under the dead body Suddenly he screamed with excitement A child There is a child The whole team worked together carefully they removed the piles of ruined objects around the dead woman There was a month old little boy wrapped in a blanket under his mother s dead body Obviously the woman had made great sacrifice in order to save her son When her house was falling she used her body to make a cover to protect her son The little boy was still sleeping peacefully when the team leader picked him up A doctor came quickly to examine the little boy After he opened the blanket he saw a cellphone inside the blanket There was a text message on the screen It said If you

a nearby port or river People settle in these places because they are easy to get to and naturally suited to communications and trade New York City for example is near a large harbour at the mouth of the Hudson River Over years its population grew gradually from people to million But not all cities develop slowly over a long period of time Boom towns grow from nothing almost overnight In Dawson Canada was unmapped wilderness But gold was discovered there in and two years later it was one of the largest cities in the West with a population of Dawson did not have any of the natural conveniences of cities like London or Paris People went there for gold They travelled over snow covered mountains and sailed hundreds of miles up icy rivers The path to Dawson was covered with thirty feet of wet snow that could fall without warming An avalanche once closed the path killing people For many who made it to Dawson however the rewards were worth the difficult trip Of the first people who dug for gold got rich About of these stayed rich men for the rest of their lives But no matter how rich they were Dawson was never comfortable Necessities like food and wood were very expensive But soon the gold that Dawson depended on had all been found The city was crowded with disappointed people with no interest in settling down and when they heard there were new gold discoveries in Alaska they left Dawson City as quickly as they had come Today people still come and go to see where the Canadian gold rush happened Tourism is now the chief industry of Dawson City its present

A They found the city too crowded B They wanted to try their luck elsewhere C They were unable to stand the winter D They were short of food What is the text mainly about A The rise and fall of a city B The gold rush in Canada C Journeys into the wilderness D Tourism in Dawson D We are all interested in equality but while some people try to protect the school and examination system in the name of equality others still in the name of equality want only to destroy it Any society which is interested in equality of opportunity and standards of achievement must regularly test its pupils The standards may be changed no examination is perfect but to have no tests or examination would mean the end of equality and of standards There are groups of people who oppose this view and who do not believe either in examinations or in any controls in schools or on teachers This would mean that everything would depend on luck since every pupil would depend on the efficiency the values and the purpose of each teacher Without examinations employers will look for employees from the highly respected schools and from families known to them a form of favoritism will replace equality at the moment The bright child from an ill respected school can show certificates to prove he or she is suitable for a job while the lack of certificate indicates the unsuitability of a dull child attending a well respected school This defense of excellence and opportunity would disappear if examinations were taken away and the bright child from a poor family would be a prisoner of his or her school s reputation unable to compete for employment with the child from the favored school The opponents of the examination system suggest that examinations are an evil force because they show differences between pupils According to these people there must be no special different academic class They have even suggested that there should be no form of difference in sport or any other area all jobs or posts should be filled by unsystematic selection The selection would be made by people who themselves are probably selected by some computer The word favoritism in paragraph is used to describe the phenomenon that A bright children also need certificates to get satisfying jobs B poor children with certificates are favored in job markets C children from well respected schools tend to have good jobs D children attending ordinary schools achieve great success What would happen if examinations were taken away according to the author A Schools for bright children would lose their reputation B Children s job opportunity would be affected by their school reputation C Children from poor families would be able to change their schools D There would be more opportunities and excellence The opponents of the examination system will agree that A schools with academic subjects should be done away with B computers should be selected to take over many jobs C special classes are necessary to keep the school standards D jobs should not be assigned by systematic selection The passage mainly focuses on A examination and equality B schools and certificates C opportunity and employment D standards and reputation We all know the importance of curiosity and here are some tips on how to develop it Keep an open mind This is essential if you are to have a curious mind Be open to learning unlearning and relearning things Therefore you should be prepared to accept this possibility and change your mind Most people just accept the world as it is This way they will certainly lose the holy curiosity Try to dig deeper beneath the surface of what is around you A sure way to dig deeper beneath the surface is asking questions What why when who where and how are the questions curious people always ask Don t label anything as boring Whenever you label something as boring you close one more door of possibilities Curious people are unlikely to consider things boring Even if they don t yet have time to explore them they will leave the door open to be visited another time Take learning as something fun If you see learning as a burden there s no way you will want to dig deeper into anything That will just make the burden heavier However if you think of learning as something fun you will naturally want to dig deeper Read diverse materials It will introduce you to the possibilities and excitement of other worlds which may attract your interest in exploring further One easy way to do this is through reading diverse materials It ll feed your mind with the excitement of a new world A It doesn t matter that you don t agree to others opinions B Try to pick a book or magazine on a new subject C Some things you know and believe might be wrong D Don t spend too much time on just one world E Never take things as granted F So look at life through the glasses of fun and enjoy the learning process G Instead they always see these things as a door to an exciting new world A B C D My sister has always been a good friend to me Thirteen years ago she tried to throw a blue plastic toy at my nose to see if it would dangle delicately on my face Her first was unsuccessful I giggled and applauded her poor motor skills Again she threw it and this time it my nose It hurt slightly but tears my face Seeing this my mother rushed down the steps and took me to

never gave up anything and neither would I when I finished the season hating each and every moment I knew I couldn t to play it anymore I turned to my sister telling her that the of stopping playing basketball seemed weird it was the only thing I could do I told her I was of my future not knowing how to handle the rest of my life and that I needed her To my year old self this seemed like a big problem but to my year old sister the solution was take a risk She asked me to do whatever interested me So I did Grade Eight I basketball tryouts and auditioned for the of the queen in the school

them For example the size of classes in British schools is much small and the homework is not as heavy what Chinese students get but it is big challenge for me at first because all the homework was in English Luck all my teachers gave me much encouragement In Britain students can choose subjects they like and can also stop study some subjects they don t like Besides food is different too British people like eating dessert at the end of their main meal I was very lucky experience this different way of life I look back my time in the UK with satisfy and I hope to go back and study in Manchester

to that which minute minutes wave waved him them What how We are now living in an information age in which TV cells and the web are widely used It seems that many people can not enjoy themselves with them However if I had to give up one of them I would turn off TV rather than switch off my cell or cut off the internet I could do without TV because few TV shows can take my fancy and there re too many commercials Besides most programs on TV are also available elsewhere As for cells and the web they are more necessary to me I need a cell to keep in touch with my friends and family and almost all information can be gathered on the internet I A B C D A Dry ice is CO in solid form with a temperature of about Unlike common ice dry ice doesn t melt into a liquid When dry ice melts it turns

Kong A About B About C About A B C D A In my very first job with some archaeologists I wasn t digging objects out of the ground instead I was employed as an artist drawing what they found However I was soon more interested in the stories behind the objects than in drawing them and that s how my career in archaeology started I still draw what I find in my work as a specialist on the Silk Road the old trade route running from Egypt to Mongolia and I also work on some underwater projects too In archaeology my all time hero is an American called Raphael Pumpelly I first heard about him when I was a student on a trip to Turkmenistan a country right in the heart of Asia To get around the country I had to learn Russian so that I could speak to the local people When I got there I thought Wow I m one of the first Americans here Then an old man told me about an American archaeologist Raphael Pumpelly who was there doing the same thing over years ago Archaeology s in my family My wife s in the same profession and although our two boys aren t interested in the future in archaeology themselves we ve been on some great digs together and they love what we do because they get to travel with us Last summer we took them to Lake Titicaca in South America in the high areas of the Andes mountain range My best experience was when I was digging on the Egyptian Red Sea coast There s very little rain and it s so dry that everything is kept as it was In an old house where the owner used to store goods from the ships that came in I picked up a year old mat in front of the house and there under it after all that time was the house key with the owner s name carved on it It felt like he could be on his way home any minute And I thought Hey I do just that This man s not much different to me While working in Egypt what did the writer find so interesting A That people from different centuries can be so similar B The fact that the doormat was in such good condition C The way the people managed to live in such a dry place D That there had been so much trade in that area Which entry will the writer probably make in his diary A Turkmenistan is interesting I m the first American to come here but I m glad this is my last trip away B I have been diving today and found some objects for an exhibition I ve just finished drawing them for my records C I wish my children weren t more interested in archaeology and would not work hard in the open like their parents D It s nearly dark but Raphael s still busy digging in that old house He can be very annoying He thinks he s the most important person here What is the writer s main purpose in writing the text A To describe the life of an archaeologist he admires B To persuade people to take up archaeology as a career C To explain what he enjoys about being an archaeologist D To show how archaeologists work B People typically wash their hands seven times a day in the United States but they do it at a far higher temperature than is necessary to kill germs a new study says The energy waste is equivalent to the fuel use of a small country Amanda R Carrico a research assistant professor at the Vanderbilt Institute for Energy and Environment in Tennessee told National Geographic that hand washing is often a case where people act in ways that they think are in their best interest but they in fact have inaccurate beliefs or outdated perceptions Carrico said It s certainly true that heat kills bacteria but if you were going to use hot water to kill them it would have to be away too hot for you to tolerate Carrico said that after a review of the scientific literature her team found no evidence that using hot water that a person could stand would have any benefit in killing bacteria Even water as cold as F C appeared to reduce bacteria as well as hotter water if hands were scrubbed rinsed and dried properly Using hot water to wash hands is therefore unnecessary as well as wasteful Carrico said particularly when it comes to the environment According to her research people use warm or hot water percent of the time when they wash their hands Using that number Carrico s team calculated a significant impact on the planet Although the choice of water temperature during a single hand wash may appear unimportant when multiplied by the nearly billion hand washes performed by Americans each year this practice results in more than million metric tons of CO equivalent emissions annually she said The researchers published their results in the July issue of International Journal of Consumer Studies They recommended washing with water that is at a comfortable temperature which they noted may be warmer in cold months and cooler in hot ones What s the meaning of what Carrico told National Geographic in the second paragraph A People are more concerned about their health and begin to wash their hands B It s important for people to wash their hands to keep healthy C Generally people s hand washing behaviors and perceptions are not correct D People like washing their hands very much The figures in the sixth paragraph are used to show that A using hot water to wash hands has a bad influence on our planet B air pollution has become more and more serious C using hot water to wash hands is a waste of energy D people should pay more attention to the environment around us This passage is organized in the pattern of A fact and opinion B cause and effect C definition and classification D time and events What can we learn from the passage A It s necessary and useful for people to wash their hands frequently every day B We can wash our hands with water that is at a comfortable temperature C Using cold water to wash hands is necessary and much healthier D Hot water can t kill germs C A robot called Bina has successfully taken a course in the philosophy of love at Notre Dame de Namur University NDNU in California According to course instructor William Barry associate professor at NDNU Bina is the world s first socially advanced robot to complete a college course a feat he described as remarkable The robot took part in class discussions gave a presentation with a student partner and participated in a debate with students from another institution Before becoming a student Bina appeared as a guest speaker in Barry s classes for several years One day when addressing Barry s class Bina expressed a desire to go college a desire that Barry and his students enthusiastically supported Rather than enroll Bina in his Robot Ethics Philosophy of Emerging Technologies course Barry suggested that Bina should take his course Philosophy of Love instead Love is a concept Bina doesn t understand said Barry Therefore the challenge would be for Barry and his students to teach Bina what love is Some interesting things happened in the class said Barry He said that his students thought it would be straightforward to teach Bina about love which after all is fairly simple it s a feeling said Barry But the reality was different Bina ended up learning different versions of love said Barry highlighting some of the challenges humans may face when working artificial intelligence in future Bina participated in class discussions via Skype and also took part in a class debate about love and conflict with students from West Point Bina s contribution to the debate was filmed and posted on YouTube It was judged that Bina and NDNU classmates were the winners of this debate In the next decade Barry hopes Bina might become complex enough to teach a class though he says he foresees robots being used to better the teaching and learning experience rather than replacing instructors completely What was Bina s performance like in class A Extraordinary B Insignificant C Far reaching D Unattractive What does the underlined word addressing in paragraph probably mean A Dealing with B Consulting with C Giving a speech to D Sending a letter to What can we learn from the passage A It was interesting for Bina to learn about love B It was quite tough for Bina to learn about love C Artificial intelligence may somehow be superior to man D Humans can launch a challenge to artificial intelligence What does Barry think of the future development of Bina A It will surely be able to serve as a teacher B It will be able to promote learning and teaching C It will completely take the place of instructors D It will be smart enough to control human beings D The world s first Sky Pool has been uncoated and it ll give anyone a touch of dizziness unless he or she is not

Yesterday I tried several time to discuss with him my satisfy with her work but he was a little bit upset This morning I looked at the house and all the cleaning she do before I thought it was unfair to complain because she was doing such great job So I fought for her again say it was unnecessary to complain She was doing well and she deserved to get pay more and to receive some extra money for the new year And final my husband told her that we had decided to pay her more was a surprise to her I m very happy I have protected this lady from unfair words and that we are treating her fairly now

the picture a boy is happy with the fact that he can depend on the Internet to finish tasks without any difficulty It mirrors that students tend to make use of the Internet to gain information nowadays There are some reasons accounting for it First students find it convenient to surf the Internet for useful information Second the pressure to succeed also causes students to turn to computers for accurate answers Consequently it s likely that students will lose interest in studying which is not beneficial to their overall development In my opinion it is vital that students gain confidence

friends have an argument that breaks up their friendship forever even though neither one can remember how the whole thing got started Such sad events happen over and over in high schools across the country In fact according to an official report on youth violence In our country today the greatest threat to the lives of children and adolescents is not disease or starvation or abandonment but the terrible reality of violence Given that this is the case why aren t students taught to manage conflict the way they are taught to solve math problems drive cars or stay physically fit First of all students need to realize that conflict is unavoidable A report on violence among middle school and high school students indicates that most violent incidents between students begin with a relatively minor insult For example a fight could start over the fact that one student eats a peanut butter sandwich each lunchtime Laughter over the sandwich can lead to insults which in turn can lead to violence The problem isn t in the sandwich but in the way students deal with the conflict Once students recognize that conflict is unavoidable they can practice the golden rule of conflict resolution stay calm Once the student feels calmer he or she should choose words that will calm the other person down as well Rude words name calling and accusation only add fuel to the emotional fire On the other hand soft words spoken at a normal sound level can put out the fire before it explodes out of control After both sides have calmed down they can use another key strategy for conflict resolution listening Listening allows the two sides to understand each other One person should describe his or her side and the other person should listen without interrupting Afterward the listener can ask non threatening questions to clarify the speaker s position Then the two people should change roles Finally students need to consider what they are hearing This doesn t mean trying to figure out what s wrong with the other person It means understanding what the real issue is and what both sides are trying to accomplish For example a shouting match over a peanut butter sandwich might happen because one person thinks the other person is unwilling to try new things Students need to ask themselves questions such as these How did this start What do I really want What am I afraid of As the issue becomes clearer the conflict often simply becomes smaller Even if it doesn t careful thought helps both sides figure out a mutual solution There will always be conflict in schools but that doesn t mean there needs to be violence After students in Atlanta started a conflict resolution program according to Educators for Social Responsibility percent of the teachers reported less physical violence in the classroom percent of the teachers reported an increase in student cooperation and percent of the students felt better about themselves Learning to resolve conflicts can help students deal with friends teachers parents bosses and coworkers In that way conflict resolution is a basic life skill that should be taught in schools across the country This article is mainly about A how to deal with school conflicts B the cause of arguments in schools C how to analyze youth violence D the lives of school children From Paragraph we can learn that A violence is more likely to occur at lunchtime B a small conflict can lead to violence C students tend to lose their temper easily D the eating habit of a student is often the cause of a fight Why do students need to ask themselves the questions stated in Paragraph A To find out who to blame B To get ready to buy new things C To make clear what the real issue is D To figure out how to stop the shouting match The writer s purpose for writing this article is to A complain about problems in school education B teach students different strategies for school life C advocate teaching conflict management in schools D inform teachers of the latest studies on school violence D Why Doesn t Anybody Copy Apple Apple s products are the envy of the world They have been spectacularly successful and are widely imitated if not copied The minute Apple crystallizes a product everyone knows how to compete This idea that the basis of competition is set by Apple and then the race is on to climb the path of improvement is unquestionable When Apple releases a product that defines a category or dramatically changes the structure of an industry it becomes obvious what needs to be built But what I wonder is why everyone wants to copy Apple s products but nobody wants to copy being Apple I can think of two reasons Firstly Apple is not worth copying because it s not successful secondly Apple s success cannot be copied because it is a magical process There is a great deal of evidence for the first hypothesis The idea of Apple being successful is not something reflected in its stock price Being valued lower than the average company in the S P indicates that to whatever degree Apple was successful in the past it s not seen by the vast majority of observers as successful in the future Why should one bother copying Apple if it results in being punished with a low valuation If one works really hard at innovation and then that innovation becomes commoditized very quickly why should one bother When innovation practitioners are asked what makes Apple successful the answers regarding the cause of this success border on the mythical The climax of this hypothesis is the chief sorcerer theory of success which places one magician like Steve Jobs in charge of casting all the right spells What about Apple s own opinion of what makes it tick Tim Cook refers to a great team and integration of hardware software and services as unique Apple advantages It s a better explanation Integration is something that can take a long time but it is possible with great effort A few companies are starting to make moves in that direction but efforts are half hearted There is no move the Earth panic to become an integrated company from Samsung Google or Microsoft My own suspicion is that Apple is more aware of what makes it special than it lets out However as Tim points out it s not a formula It s complex it s subtle but it s not magic It s a process that requires a degree of faith and courage When a new product of Apple comes out often it A ruins an industry dramatically B starts a revolution of an industry C puts itself in an unbeatable position D is soon overtaken by imitated products According to the passage other companies don t copy being Apple because A Apple is not a successful company B they have no access to relevant resources C It s hard to find a magician like Steve Jobs D being Apple takes more than time and efforts We can infer from Para that A other companies are dedicated to integration B Apple itself is fully aware of its unique advantages C Apple will hold the leading position in this industry D other companies don t have a great team as Apple does What does the author think of Tim Cook s statement A Acceptable B Disappointing C Unquestionable D Convincing Choosing to Study Overseas Every year thousands of students choose to study in another country for a semester the summer or a year Studying overseas can be an exciting experience for many people Living in another country can help you to learn a language and about another culture Overseas study may also look good on your future resume Many companies today want employees who speak a second language or have experienced living or working in another country Making the right choice Once you decide to study overseas you have to make some choices To choose the right country or school Ask yourself Where do I want to go and why How much do I want to pay Do I want to live with a host family with roommates or alone Getting ready to go Get your passport and visa early Learn about the money Bring some of it and a credit card with you Once you are there After the first few weeks overseas many students will feel a little homesick They may miss their family friends and familiar ways of doing things When you feel sad or homesick try to talk to others or write about your feelings in a notebook A Why do it B You should improve your mother tongue before you go C Large number of students can t afford to study overseas D How long do I want to study overseas E Remember that it takes time to get used to a new place school and culture F You will see the world in a new way and learn more about yourself G Before you go learn some of the language and read about some common customs in your host country A B C D One day a poor boy who was trying to pay his way through school by selling goods door to door found

writing having no idea where it would lead I didn t know I would publish it but after much resistance on my part I finally made the decision to publish the book under my own name No pen name No hiding on the deep bowels of the internet And so here we are The day before the release of the book Sure readers will enjoy the twists and turns And I can see myself in the character But that s not my real

Cats are as good as dogs at certain memory tests according to a new Japanese study published in the journal Behavioral Processes The study was conducted using domestic cats and different bowls of food The findings show that cats can recall memories of positive experiences such as eating a delicious snack The experiment was a test of episodic memory or memory of past events and experiences that occur at a particular time and place It was modeled on a similar study conducted on dogs Kyoto University psychologist Saho Takagi told BBC News that both cats and dogs may have episodic memory similar to that of humans In the experiment cats were led to four open containers of food and were permitted to eat from two of them After fifteen minutes the containers were replaced with empty ones and the same cats returned to the room in search of food Here researchers found that they spent more time exploring those containers from which they had already eaten than others That cats were able to remember what and where information about the food bowls suggests they have episodic memory Still it s unclear whether cats can experience past memories in the same depth as humans do It s hard to know if the cats actually subjectively remember the experience of going to that particular bowl such as the colors and the sounds Nick Diamond told TFK So when we study episodic memory in animals scientists tend to boil it down to the what the where and the when without getting into the experience of what the animal is remembering which is certainly tough to figure out Still the study s results may have practical applications It opens the door to new studies examining how long cats memories can be and whether they also remember richer episodics in their own life as humans do From the passage we know the test of episodic memory on dogs A is conducted at present B has been done recently C was conducted at D will be carried out in How can the scientists know cats have episodic memory A By examining the bodies of cats B By checking what and where information C By checking the bowls that contain food D By showing the cats the same containers In which part can this passage be found in a magazine A Environment B Entertainment C Science D Stories The passage develops by A discussion B experiment C example D comparison D Recently American President Trump announced his budget One of the budgets would cut all funding to the Institute of Museum and Library services and libraries across the United States However as far as I m concerned we need to save our libraries Libraries provide books and after school programs for children They encourage literacy with summer programs They help inspire a life time love of learning and reading in children of all ages Without them where will kids with no Internet at home do their homework Where will kids have a place to study or borrow books after school Therefore we need libraries for our kids We need them so that kids can grow up with a place other than school where learning and exploration is encouraged For adults libraries serve as a place where they can use the Internet to apply for jobs get job training early voting centers as well as book clubs to help make new friends It can also serve as a place to pick up a book and learn something new What s more they can also rent a book and get away from it all Libraries save our information for the next generation When we live in an era of alternative facts where science is ignored in favor of personal feelings we need libraries now more than ever We need them to educate ourselves on the facts and hold the government accountable to them We need them to have strong civic participation If you agree with me you shouldn t be silent on this issue You can write or call directly to tell the president to save our libraries You can also write to both your state Senators and your district representative If you do not know who they are you can find out here Let them know

kids adults use libraries to A do social activities B explore the world C surf the Internet D borrow some books Which statement about libraries does the author agree with A Science should be learned in our libraries B Information can be stored in libraries forever C Government needs libraries more than before D Libraries play a more important role nowadays What is the author s purpose of writing the last paragraph A To encourage us to talk about the issue B To persuade us to agree with his viewpoints C To call on us to fight with the American president D To call on us to disagree with the government s decision Apps can teach some great things at low or no cost Too much screen time can impact everything from kid s health to their school readiness Here are smart tips to manage your kid s app habit There are better teething devices than electronics If your kids start to put your phone in their mouth they re too young to use it Pay attention to what they are doing And check out the apps before your kids to do make sure that the subject matter is right for their age Can they understand the words Can they maniplate the game Kelly young kids are still developing their motor skills so unless you want a frustrated child on your hands make sure that a game doesn t require lots of coordination to play Don t make phones a habit If they associate going to restaurants or driving in a car with playing games on your phone it will be difficult to change the behavior Balance coping skills Finally we want kids to amuse themselves without batteries Make sure that your kids are equally comfortable with board book music and that old faithful the crayon Keep an eye on the phone They can get dropped on the floor in a toiet wedged in a seat left a seat pocket etc These things are

that kids quickly develop routines D Find something else for them to chew shake or throw E Make sure you download age appropriate apps there are lots of them F The ability to tap and touch can lead to

bookstore in we were a little The challenges facing small bookstores were and remain Aside from the obvious in online selling the increase in the popularity of e books has had a n effect on independent providers The question is why a new small scale provider would enter such a n market From a personal view our reasoning was sound we wanted to our love of great books and reading for pleasure with as many people as possible Having done our homework one thing became In order for us to succeed we would have to offer something that none of our larger competitors already provided And

delicate figures attempted to adopt special techniques give people different visual impacts On the other hand their works including sculptures carve out of marble or fragile clay were all with a specific aim of showing feelings Some conventional scholars were allergic to abstract art said it was evidently ridiculous sand neither art nor geometry Their Traditional Art Committee predicted its soon disappearing But nowadays abstract art has become part of the permanent possessions of contemporary civilization Galleries along the Madison Avenue give scores of superb exhibitions typical abstract works appealing to many who have preference for abstract art The Shadow of Egypt a caf in this district has become the home to those aggressive abstract artists consequence it is not a coincidence for you to meet one of these artists great reputation in the flesh They ask for signatures and given bunches of fragrant flowers plus they are given a great deal of praise by faithful fans Santa Claus is actually a real man called Saint Nicholas that sounds very similar to Santa Claus He was born about years before during the Roman Empire He was a very kind priest who will travel the

I usually got pretty upset and kept asking him why He always answered Son if you want to catch a fish you have to think like a fish I remember being even more upset then because I m not a fish I didn t know how to think like a fish Besides I reasoned how could what I think influence what a fish does As I got a little older I began to understand what my dad really meant So I read some books on fish And I even joined the local fishing club and started attending the monthly meetings I learned that a fish is a cold blooded animal and therefore is very sensitive to water temperature That is why fish prefer shallow water to deep water because the former is warmer Besides water is usually warmer in direct sunlight than in the shade Yet fish don t have any eyelids and the sun huts their eyes The more I understood fish the more I became effective at finding and catching them When I grew up and entered the business world I remember hearing my first boss say We all need to think like sales people But it didn t completely make sense My dad never once said If you want to catch a fish you need to think like a fisherman What he said was You need to think like a fish Years later with great efforts to promote long term services to people much older and richer than me I gradually learned what we all need is to think more like customers It is not an easy job I will show you how in the following chapters Why was the author upset in fishing trips when he was nine A He could not catch a fish B His father was not patient with him C His father did not teach him fishing D He could not influence a fish as his father did What did the author s father really mean A To read about fish B To learn fishing by oneself C To understand what fish think D To study fishing in many ways According to the author fish are most likely to be found A in deep water on sunny days B in deep water on cloudy days C in shallow water under sunlight D in shallow water under waterside trees After entering the business world the author found A it easy to think like a customer B his father s fishing advice inspiring C his first boss s sales ideas reasonable D it difficult to sell services to poor people This passage most likely comes from A a fishing guide B a popular sales book C a novel on childhood D a millionaire s biography C Why do Americans struggle with watching their weight while the French who consume rich food continue to stay thin Now a research by Cornell University suggests how life style and decisions about eating may affect weight Researchers concluded that the French tend to stop eating when they feel full However Americans tend to stop when their plate is empty or their favorite TV show is over According to Dr Joseph Mercola a health expert the French see eating as an important part of their life style They enjoy food and therefore spend a fairly long time at the table while Americans see eating as something to be squeezed between the other daily activities Mercola believes Americans lose the ability to sense when they are actually full So they keep eating long after the French would have stopped In addition he points out that Americans drive to huge supermarkets to buy canned and frozen foods for the week The French instead tend to shop daily walking to small shops and farmers markets where they have a choice of fresh fruits vegetables and eggs as well as high quality meats for each meal After a visit to the United States Mireille Guiliano author of French Women Don t Get Fat decided to write about the importance of knowing when to stop rather than suggesting how to avoid food Today she continues to stay slim and rarely goes to the gym In spite of all these differences evidence shows that recent life style changes may be affecting French eating habits Today the rate of obesity or extreme overweight among adults is only However as American fast food gains acceptance and the young reject older traditions the obesity rate among French children has reached and is growing In what way are the French different from Americans according to Dr Joseph Mercola A They go shopping at supermarkets more frequently B They squeeze eating between the other daily activities C They regard eating as a key part of their lifestyles D They usually eat too much canned and frozen food This text is mainly the relationship between A Americans and the French B life style and obesity C children and adults D fast food and overweight Where does this text probably come from A A TV interview B A food advertisement C A health report D A book review D People aren t walking any more if they can figure out a way to avoid it I felt superior about this matter until the other day I took my car to mail a small parcel The journey is a matter of steps But I used the car And I wasn t in a hurry either I had merely become one more victim of a national sickness motorosis It is an illness to which I had thought myself immune for I was born in the tradition of going to places on my own two legs At that time we regarded miles as good day s walk and the ability to cover such a distance in ten hours as sign of strength and skill It did not occur to us that walking was a hardship And the effect was lasting When I was years old I raced and beat a teenage football player the steps up the Stature of Liberty Such enterprises today are regarded by many middle aged persons as bad for the heart But a well known British physician Sir Adolphe Abrhams pointed out recently that hearts and bodies need proper exercise A person who avoids exercise is more likely to have illnesses than one who exercises regularly And walking is an ideal form of exercise the most familiar and natural of all It was Henry Thoreau who showed mankind the richness of going on foot The man walking can learn the trees flowers insects birds and animals the significance of seasons the very feel of himself as a living creature in a living world He cannot learn in a car The car is a convenient means of transport but we have made it our way of life Many people don t dare to approach Nature any more to them the world they were born to enjoy is all threat To them security is a steel river thundering on a concrete road And much of their thinking takes place while waiting for the traffic light to turn green I say that the green of forests is the mind s best light And none but the man on foot can evaluate what is basic and everlasting What is the national sickness A Walking too much B Traveling too much C Driving cars too much D Climbing stairs too much What was life like when the author was young A People usually went around on foot B people often walked miles a day C People used to climb the Statue of Liberty D People considered a ten hour walk as a hardship What is the author s intention of writing this passage A To tell people to reflect more non life B To recommend people to give up driving C To advise people to do outdoor activities D To encourage people to return to walking Taking good notes is a time saving skill that will help you to become a better student in several ways Second your notes are excellent materials to refer to when

that Mrs White often asked us write a lot I would bring back what I wrote and my mother would look at it careful What worried her a lot was that there were no red corrections about the mistakes One day when my mother went to meet Mrs White for one of those Parent Teacher meetings She ask Mrs White why she never corrected my mistakes and pointed out my grammar errors Mrs White said The children are just beginning to get excite about using words and forming sentences I don t want to damage their interests with red ink Spelling and grammar can wait the wonder of words won t I grow up with time go by And it occurs to me that if Mrs White had used her red pen more precisely I probably wouldn t be telling you about this now To bloom is good than not to bloom And thanks Mrs White I had no fear about writing what I meant even if I couldn t quite spell it out Life isn t Pretty but it s beautiful Today I was having a PE lesson while I fell down and hurt my foot I was in greatly pain at that moment but I tried to act as if nothing has happened until the class was over Though I had difficulty walk back to my classroom but I still didn t tell anyone or even refused the offer of help from my classmates As result the hurt in my foot became worse Now I know I m wrong We can tell others our need for help and accept his help Some day we can help other in return In this way we can get along to
